"""The store lock is released before an engine error becomes a Python exception.

Defect #17. `graph_err` opens with `Python::attach`, so building the exception
needs the GIL. The four reads that call `with_scope` from inside
`py.allow_threads` — `find_similar`, `pairwise_similar`, `degree`, `degrees` —
take the store `Mutex` first and then the GIL; every other method holds the GIL
and then blocks on the same `Mutex`. Mapping the error while the guard is still
alive puts those two orders in a cycle on one `Arc<Inner>`.

**Why these run in a subprocess.** Once the cycle closes, the thread holding the
GIL is blocked on the `Mutex` forever, so nothing else in that interpreter runs
again — including the main thread, whose `Thread.join(timeout=...)` releases the
GIL to wait and can never reacquire it. An in-process threaded test would
therefore hang the whole run instead of failing it, which is worse than having
no test at all. A child process can be timed out and killed from outside, so the
failure is reported as a failure.
