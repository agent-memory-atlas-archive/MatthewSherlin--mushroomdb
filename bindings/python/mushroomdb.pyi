        It shares this handle's store and mutex — not a second open, no second
        lock, one small allocation — so `close()` on either name closes both.

        At least one leg is required; none raises `ValueError`. Legs intersect,
        so `scoped()` on a scoped handle narrows further and never widens, and
        `keys=[]` narrows to nothing. An unknown `role` raises here, not on the
        first read.

        Every read obeys one contract: the subject is checked first, so a key
        outside the scope is indistinguishable from a key that does not exist —
        `node_info` answers `None`, `node_edges` raises `KeyNotFound`,
        `node_history` is empty. Then every other node the answer would mention
        — neighbour, endpoint, candidate, evidence — is filtered to the scope,
        so `degree` counts only visible neighbours and `find_similar`,
        `pairwise_similar` and `search_hybrid` score only visible candidates.

        The scope resolves per read, so a handle held across a write is never
        stale. `refresh()` is permitted. `has_vector_rule` and
        `is_index_enabled` answer unscoped: they are schema, not node data.
