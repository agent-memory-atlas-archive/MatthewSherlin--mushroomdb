## v0.6.10 — scoped reads and stable errors

A scope stops being an argument you have to remember on every call and becomes a
property of the handle. `db.scoped(role=…, namespace=…, keys=[…])` returns a
read-only child sharing the same store, and every read on it obeys one rule:
**hidden behaves exactly as absent.** The role-read contract that until now lived
only in the HTTP server lives in the engine, once, and HTTP calls it. Alongside
that: every engine failure is a stable Python class that still subclasses
`RuntimeError`, a mirror can be rebuilt onto a store that already has content,
and insert-count multiplicity is available to the stores that ask for it. Nothing
an existing caller does changes behaviour, and stores stay V9 and upgrade in
place — unless you call `enable_multiplicity()`, which is the one opt-in step
with a one-way consequence, described under **Added** and again under **Known
limits**.

#### Added

- **`db.scoped(role=…, namespace=…, keys=[…])` — a scope is a property of the
  handle.** It returns a `GraphDb`-shaped child sharing this handle's store and
  mutex: not a second open, no second lock, one small allocation, and `close()`
  on either name closes both. At least one leg is required (none raises
  `ValueError`); legs intersect, so `scoped()` on a scoped handle narrows further
  and never widens, and `keys=[]` narrows to nothing. An unknown role raises at
  `scoped()`, not on the first read. Every mutation raises `ReadOnly` —
  `snapshot`, `create_rule`, `enable_index` and `ingest_batch` included —
  while `refresh()` is permitted because it writes nothing.
- **Every read on a scoped handle applies the scope, under one contract.** The
  subject is checked first, so *a key outside the scope is indistinguishable from
  a key that does not exist*; then every other node the answer would mention —
  neighbour, endpoint, candidate, evidence — is filtered to the scope. Which
  answer "absent" is stays a per-method fact, so each surface answers what it
  already answers for an unknown key: `node_info` → `None`; `node_edges`,
  `neighbors`, `explain`, `degree`, `what_if_set_prop` → `KeyNotFound`;
  `node_history`, `edge_history`, `edges_at` → empty; `was_linked` → `False`;
  `get_edge_prop` → `None`. Raising for a hidden subject on a surface that
  returns empty for an absent one would be the existence oracle the contract
  exists to prevent. `stats` keeps store-wide counts and narrows only its
  namespace roster; `has_vector_rule` and `is_index_enabled` answer unscoped,
  being schema rather than node data.
- **The scope resolves per read, not once at `scoped()`.** A resolved allow-list
  is cached against the store's commit sequence, so a repeated read costs an
  integer compare while a read after a write rebuilds. A handle held across a
  write can never serve a stale allow-list, which would be a leak rather than a
  staleness bug, and a 50,000-key `keys=` leg does not pay 50,000 lookups per
  read.
- **`degree` counts only visible neighbours, and `pairwise_similar` drops hidden
  keys before the matmul.** A count is arithmetic that discloses, so an
  unfiltered one leaks the hidden neighbours the edge filter exists to hide; and
  a hidden vector that reaches the Gram influences a score even when it never
  appears as a result. `search_hybrid` filters both legs **before** RRF fusion,
  so the ranks are the ranks of the visible corpus and `k` is honoured.
  `explain` omits an explanation whose evidence path crosses a hidden node
  entirely rather than redacting it.
- **Masked engine entry points for the four surfaces that had none** —
  `pairwise_similar`, `search_hybrid`, `explain`, `degree`/`degrees` — plus
  `_scoped` wrappers that add the subject check, each with a `ReaderSnapshot`
  twin so the HTTP role paths keep reading one coherent lock-free epoch.
  `pairwise_similar` measures its size caps (Gram ≤ 4,096, gemv ≤ 8,192 unique
  keys) on the **post-filter** count, so a scope can bring an over-cap call under
  it. `node_edges_masked` keeps its looser, documented subject contract for the
  full-token path; the new wrapper is what tightens it for role-scoped callers.
- **A stable exception class per engine error.** `MushroomError(RuntimeError)`
  is the base and eighteen subclasses hang off it — `KeyNotFound`,
  `DuplicateKey`, `IoError`, `Corrupt`, `RuleInvalid`, `RuleOwned`,
  `RuleNotFound`, `QueryError`, `IngestError`, `ReadOnly`, `CommitOutOfRange`,
  `ViewPropReadOnly`, `CasConflict`, `MaskedReadOnly`, `RoleWriteDenied`,
  `MushroomBusy`, `NamespaceImmutable`, `CrossNamespace`. Each carries `.code`, a
  stable snake_case string that reads the same off the class and off a caught
  instance, and the variant's own fields as attributes (`e.key`, `e.floor`,
  `e.view_name`, `e.from_`). **`.code` is the compatibility surface**: classes may
  be added, a code is never respelled. `str(e)` is the message the engine has
  always produced, so existing logs and substring checks are unaffected, and
  because the base subclasses `RuntimeError` every `except RuntimeError` written
  against an earlier release keeps catching exactly what it caught.
  `MushroomBusy` is reparented onto `MushroomError` and stays a `RuntimeError`.
  A test asserts every `GraphError` variant maps to a distinct class, so adding a
  variant in Rust without adding a class fails the build.
- **`ingest_batch(nodes, edges, on_conflict="error" | "skip" | "replace")`.** A
  mirror rebuilds onto a store that already has content without wiping the
  directory and without one duplicate key rejecting a 100,000-row frame.
  `"error"` is the default and is the previous behaviour exactly. `"skip"` leaves
  the stored node untouched. `"replace"` makes its properties exactly the supplied
  props — fields absent from them are removed — while a label that differs from
  the stored one and an `ns` that would move the node are **row errors**, not
  silent rewrites. Two properties sit outside "exactly" because neither is the
  caller's to supply: `ns`, which is immutable, and any property a view owns,
  which is kept rather than removed and counted in `kept_view_owned`. The frame
  stays atomic — only the definition of "valid" changes — and the report gains
  `skipped`, `replaced` and `kept_view_owned` beside `inserted` and
  `edges_inserted`.
- **`db.roles()`** returns what `roles.json` defines (`name`, `labels`, `keys`,
  `namespaces`, `visible_where`), so a sidecar can validate a role name at boot
  instead of discovering it on the first request. `[]` when no roles are defined,
  and it **raises `Corrupt`** when `roles.json` was corrupt at open, because an
  unrestricted store answers `[]` too and a poisoned one must not read as
  "nothing is restricted here".
- **`GraphDb.restore(src, dst)`** in Python, wrapping the CLI's semantics: a
  backup directory or a directory of them, `latest` winning outright and
  otherwise the newest by mtime, staged inside `dst` and opened there before
  anything is moved into place. A non-empty `dst` is **refused, not merged**. It
  returns `{outcome, from, files, bytes}`. `restore_plus_refresh_answers_identically`
  pins the round trip: `query`, exact `find_similar`, `degree`, `stats` and
  `node_history` agree row for row with the source store.
- **Opt-in insert-count multiplicity.** `enable_multiplicity()` starts recording
  a per-pair insert count on a store; `is_multiplicity_enabled()` reads it back;
  `degree(..., multiplicity=True)` and `degrees(..., multiplicity=True)` sum it.
  Both default to `False`, so every existing caller keeps unique-neighbour
  semantics, and `multiplicity=True` on a store that never opted in answers the
  unique count rather than erroring — the argument is a readout preference, not a
  demand the store cannot meet. A duplicate insert increments the count and
  leaves unique degree alone; `insert_edge` still returns `Ok(false)`, because its
  contract is "was this pair new". `delete_edge` clears the count with the pair.
  CSR stays a set: no multi-edges. On a scoped handle a multiplicity count sums
  visible pairs only. Duplicates whose endpoints and edge type are created in the
  same frame count too — that is how a mirror rebuild writes — because the count
  is resolved in the one pass that knows the frame's own ids.
- **Snapshot `VERSION_10`, written only by a store that opted in.** The count is
  carried by a new WAL record (discriminant **23**, appended as
  `docs/format-stability.md` permits), and a pre-0.6.10 decoder cannot read one.
  Left alone that would be worse than a refusal: an older binary treats the first
  unreadable record as a corrupt WAL tail, replays only the commits before it,
  and — `repair_wal` being the default — **persists that truncation**. So opting
  in also stamps the snapshot at a version older binaries do not know, and writes
  that snapshot **before** the declaration record. The snapshot is read before the
  WAL, so an older binary stops at `snapshot: unsupported version 10` with the
  WAL byte-unchanged. **It refuses the store by name instead of silently
  discarding commits**, which is what the version stamp bought. V10 is V9's
  container with a different stamp — no new section, no new field — and the
  snapshot keeps the WAL, so every commit `open_at` could reach before the call it
  can still reach after it. **A store that never calls `enable_multiplicity()`
  writes V9, carries no discriminant-23 record, and stays readable by 0.6.9 —
  and by every release back to 0.6.5, where V9 itself landed — indefinitely.**
- **`docs/site/multiprocess.md`**, in the docs bundle: the deployment shapes that
  are supported — one writer with N refreshing readers, and N writers serialised
  by the advisory lock, where `Busy` after a 2 s wait means nothing was written
  and a retry is safe — and the ones that are not. Nothing disables the lock, so
  the page says that plainly rather than implying a configuration; what is
  genuinely reachable is a non-mushroomdb process editing the store directory, and
  two paths to the same directory, where the lock is held per inode. A store
  directory on a network filesystem is not supported.

#### Changed

- **`NodeMask` picks its representation by density.** A visible set becomes a
  bitset when `len * 64 >= span` (`span` being one past the largest visible id)
  and stays a `HashSet` otherwise — read as memory rather than density, the
  bitset is chosen precisely when it is no larger than the set it replaces, so a
  role seeing ten nodes at the top of a ten-million-id store stays sparse by four
  orders of magnitude. The rule is evaluated once at construction, from the
  distinct count, and fixed for the set's life. This release puts `contains_id`
  in the inner loop of nine more surfaces, which is what made it worth measuring;
  `crates/core-api/tests/mask_bench.rs` is the committed measurement, over a
  200,000-node store, release profile, five processes of 51 repetitions each:

  | 200,000 nodes | 2,000 visible (stays sparse) | 50,000 visible (becomes dense) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `query_masked` | 1396.8 → 1374.9 µs | 7983.9 → 5685.5 µs — **−28.8%** |
  | masked `find_similar` | 1415.7 → 1416.3 µs | 10272.0 → 7967.0 µs — **−22.4%** |
  | `neighborhood_masked` | 2469.5 → 2474.8 µs | 2401.1 → 2392.4 µs — −0.4% |

  The 2,000-id column is the control: the rule leaves that mask a `HashSet`, and
  it is flat, which is what says the enum around the set costs nothing.
  `neighborhood_masked` is flat at both sizes because the probe is about 1% of a
  BFS that spends its time expanding edges and building rows. The win is where
  the probe is the work. Hits, ordering and every existing answer are unchanged —
  `contains_id` is a set-membership predicate, and set membership did not move.
- **A role-token read of a store whose reader overlay will not fold now answers
  400 naming the corruption**, where it previously answered `404 node key not
  found`. Every other existing HTTP response is byte-identical across the move of
  the role branches onto the engine, pinned by the route tests unedited. This one
  is a deliberate exception: a 404 tells a caller the key is not there, so they
  retry it or drop it and nobody learns the store is damaged.
- **`sanitize` tests `is_ascii()` first**, which undoes a 0.6.9 regression. 0.6.9
  widened the predicate from a bare `is_ascii_control()` to the full
  bidi/zero-width class and paid for it on a hot path: every character of every
  digest string fell through six `matches!` arms a plain byte can never hit. Over
  ~400 KB of representative digest text the 0.6.9 form ran 40% slower than the
  0.6.8 predicate it replaced — 588 µs against 420. The fast path brings it to
  309 µs, 27% faster than 0.6.8, for identical output on every input.
- **The `.pyi` stub says what the Rust doc comments say, and a check keeps it
  that way.** Forty-two of the stub's docstrings were one-liners while the
  compiled `__doc__` documented the contract — an IDE hover and a type-checker
  read the stub. `scripts/check-pyi.sh` — run by CI beside
  `scripts/check-claims.sh` — now fails when a stub method's docstring is a
  single line while the Rust doc comment it stands for runs to more than three,
  so the drift cannot silently return.
- **`find_similar`'s exactness rule is stated where callers read it** —
  `docs/site/api.md`, `docs/site/mcp.md` and the Python README each say that
  **`mask=` alone, and a `scoped()` handle, are the approximate path**, and name
  the two exact ones (`exact=True`, or a `where=` predicate). A scope deliberately
  does *not* imply `exact`: that would silently turn a fast ANN call into an O(n)
  GEMM for every existing masked caller. The same three places now state that a
  `where=` predicate uses the property index only when a `label` accompanies it
  and `(label, field)` is index-enabled — without a label it is a
  correct-but-slower scan — and `distance = 1 - sim` is stated on the
  `pairwise_similar` entry, which had been missing it.
- **`docs/site/masks.md` names `scoped()` as the one scoping front door**, with
  the "hidden is absent" contract quoted where it is defined.

#### Fixed

- **`insert_node` accepted a property a view owns.** Every path that *removed* a
  view-owned property refused; creation consulted the view store nowhere, on
  three separate paths — `GraphDb::insert_node`, `BatchOp::InsertNode`, and the
  no-conflict arm of the new `on_conflict` insert. The store served the caller's
  number until something touched that node and answered the view's after a
  reopen: a `Doc` inserted with a degree view's own `deg` of `777` read `777` for
  the life of the handle and `0` after a restart. The refusal is now at the one
  choke-point all three pass through and comes before the duplicate-key check, so
  the answer does not depend on what the store already holds; the `on_conflict`
  path raises the identical **row** error on a fresh key that it already raised
  on a taken one, rather than failing the frame.
- **A scoped explanation never reports a weight computed over a hidden node**,
  and evidence visibility respects the deriving rule's namespace.
- **`get_edge_prop`, `was_linked`, `edges_at` and the two history readouts no
  longer distinguish hidden from absent** on a scoped handle.
- **The Python binding builds its exception after releasing the store lock.**
  The new error classes are constructed with the interpreter attached; doing that
  under the store mutex made `find_similar`, `pairwise_similar`, `degree` and
  `degrees` take mutex-then-GIL while every other method took GIL-then-mutex — an
  ABBA inversion on the one `Arc` every `scoped()` child shares, reachable from
  any threaded caller and invisible to a single-threaded test. The three locking
  helpers now bind the result, drop the guard, and map afterwards; a subprocess
  test with a timeout is the regression net, and a source-reading test holds the
  two helpers no runtime test can reach.
- **`enable_multiplicity()` no longer loses its declaration** to a path that
  rewrites the WAL, and a same-frame duplicate is counted rather than silently
  skipped.

#### Known limits

- **The scale benchmark's two growth assertions stay red.** The build grows
  15.48× from 2,000 to 10,000 vectors against a ceiling of 8×, and 50,000 vectors
  take 1,018.05 s against a ceiling of 300 s. Those are the figures committed in
  [`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md);
  nothing here re-measures them, and closing either means cutting the
  distance-evaluation count itself.
- **`enable_multiplicity()` is not atomic, and an exception does not undo it.**
  The declaration record can already be in the log with only its fsync having
  failed, and the V10 snapshot alone can be enough for the next open to finish the
  job — so a call that raises may leave the store opted in, immediately or on the
  next open. The failure direction is the safe one, because the V10 stamp precedes
  the record on every path and an older binary therefore refuses such a store by
  name rather than truncating it. But the exception means *outcome unknown*, not
  *nothing happened*: reopen and call `is_multiplicity_enabled()` to find out
  where the store stands. There is no call that opts a store back out.
- **Opting in and archiving in different sessions forfeits the archive genesis
  chain.** `enable_multiplicity()` writes a snapshot, and a store decides at its
  **first** archive whether `open_at` may reach into archives — saying no whenever
  a snapshot it cannot vouch for already exists. A snapshot the same handle took,
  keeping the WAL, it can vouch for, so opting in and taking that first archive in
  one session keeps the reach. Across sessions it does not, which is the answer
  any store with a prior snapshot already gets.
- **Counting costs a property lookup per neighbour.** Over 20,000 nodes at fanout
  4 with every pair inserted twice, snapshotted and reopened,
  `degrees(multiplicity=True)` takes 14.11 ms against 2.18 ms for the unique
  reading — about 6.5×. Hoisting the per-row view rebuild out of the loop removed
  2.57 ms of that; the remaining ~12 ms is inherent, being 80,000 edge-property
  reads the unique path does not do at all. It is paid only by callers who pass
  `multiplicity=True`, which defaults to `False` everywhere.
- **A corrupt store is reported with two different HTTP statuses.** The shared
  error mapping answers 400 while the role-mask path answers 500, so the same
  store answers one or the other depending on whether the role-mask memo was
  warm. Fixing it means changing an error mapping under every route and is
  deferred to 0.6.11 rather than done in a release's last hours. Relatedly, a
  full-access token can read `200 OK` from a store a role token is told is
  corrupt: the role path folds the reader's delta tail while the full-token path
  reads the authoritative handle, and where they disagree the `200` is the correct
  answer.
- **`find_similar`'s `min` defaults differently by surface.** MCP vector mode
  defaults it to `0.8`; Python and HTTP default it to `0.0`. A call ported between
  them without an explicit `min` changes its results silently. Both surfaces now
  say so and name the other's value; unifying them would break one set of callers
  without an error, so it is proposed for 0.7, where a breaking note is
  affordable. Pass `min` explicitly.
- **HNSW search is still approximate unless you ask otherwise.** `exact=True` or
  a `where=` predicate force the exact GEMM path; `mask=` alone, and a `scoped()`
  handle, ride the widening beam. `search_hybrid` takes no exactness argument at
  all, so its vector leg is the approximate one whenever an HNSW rule covers the
  field.
- **A scoped handle is read-only, and a scope is a key list or a field
  predicate — not a query.** Scoped writes would mean routing through the
  `RoleWriteDenied` decision table, which is a larger surface than this patch;
  dual-write through the unscoped handle instead. And a scope whose membership is
  computed by a traversal inside the engine — the thing that would let an embedder
  stop computing its readable set in another database — is deliberately deferred:
  a `keys=` handle scope collapses N per-call round trips into one readable-set
  query per request and removes the leak, but it does **not** remove that query.
- **`scoped()` and `mask=` are cooperative, not an access boundary.** They are
  in-process argument handling, and the MCP surface still has no auth. Real
  enforcement is the HTTP server's role tokens, which is exactly why this release
  moved their read contract into the engine.

## v0.6.9 — engine polish

Surfaces that told the truth about themselves, mostly. Cypher's identity fields
resolve and plan as point lookups instead of label scans; a write statement's
`RETURN` evaluates what a read's does; the MCP and HTTP surfaces gained the two
exact-read entry points 0.6.8 left out; and the vector index now persists the
judgements it makes about vectors it cannot hold, instead of re-deriving them on
every open. No snapshot-format change: stores stay V9 and upgrade in place.

#### Added

- **`n.id` and `id(n)` read the node key**, with the same stored-wins rule
  `n.key` / `key(n)` already had: a stored property of that name beats the key
  for the property form, and the function form is always the id-map key.
- **Identity equality is a point lookup.** `WHERE n.key` / `n.id` / `key(n)` /
  `id(n)` against a literal or `$param` plans as `ScanKey` rather than a label
  scan. The property form keeps stored-wins by filtering the key hit and
  unioning nodes whose stored field matches; the function form is the key
  lookup alone.
- **Write-statement `RETURN` evaluates `CASE` and list subscripts**, and
  identity fields, the same way a read `RETURN` does.
- **Python `query_at` takes `role=` and `namespace=`** like live `query`, and
  **`upsert_node`'s update is one commit** rather than one per property.
- **`POST /find_similar`** over HTTP, taking `field`, `vector`, `k`, `min`,
  `label`, `mask`, `where` and `exact`. A role token's mask intersects a
  caller-supplied one; it never widens.
- **MCP `pairwise_similar`**, listed immediately after `find_similar`.
- **MHNS blob version 4 persists parked vectors and refusals.** The blob now
  carries `dim_mismatches`, the refused node ids and the parked rows (in the
  slab's `f32` unit), so a reopen restores them instead of re-deriving them by
  re-offering every vector. The open-time scan and the sliced build both skip
  ids the index already accounts for. `complete` is still the blob's last field,
  so the completeness check reads it without decoding. **A 0.6.8 binary meeting a
  v4 blob fails its version check and falls back to the exhaustive scan —
  slower, never wrong**, the same contract v3 already had. Snapshot `VERSION`
  is unchanged at 9.
- **`ingest-git` reports `evicted` beside `deleted`.** A node dropped because
  the path it was renamed *to* did not survive the window is an eviction: no
  path the window deleted ever named it. A rename into an excluded path stays a
  delete. Both print in the summary and both appear in the JSON.

#### Changed

- **The association listing is sixteen tools**, `pairwise_similar` added after
  `find_similar`.
- **Unscoped MCP `stats` omits `namespaces` entirely.** Passing `role` or
  `namespace` still returns the roster that argument may see. Omitted rather
  than emptied: `"namespaces": []` still discloses that a roster exists.
- **HTTP `neighborhood` answers 404 for an absent key**, body
  `node key not found: {key}`, matching the other node routes.
- **`sanitize` covers bidi and zero-width characters**, not only ASCII
  controls: U+0085, U+2028, U+2029, U+200B–U+200F, U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069
  and U+FEFF. One char in, one char out, so a character budget is unaffected and
  the byte length can only shrink. Neutralising only the four code points that
  prompted this would have left U+202D and U+0085 as bypasses.
- **`masks.md` and `service.md` join the docs bundle**, closing a 0.6.5/0.6.6
  known limit.
- **Kernel scratch is reused** across beam searches, and GEMM `pack` skips a
  second L2 on a vector that is already unit. Hits, order and
  distance-evaluation counts are unchanged on a fixed seed.

#### Fixed

- **`WHERE key(n) = 'x'` and `WHERE id(n) = 'x'` returned the wrong rows.** The
  identity fold tagged the function form with the same field name as the
  property form, so the stored-wins rule was applied to it: a node whose stored
  `key` property was `'K'` matched `key(n) = 'K'` though its own key was not,
  and a node whose stored `id` differed from its key was hidden from
  `id(n) = <its key>`. Found in review before release; the function form now
  plans as a plain `ScanKey`.
- **The docs claimed `n.id` is always null and `n.key` does not resolve.** Both
  were true before this release and are not now.
- **The `OpenOptions` snippet in the format-stability page compiles.**

#### Known limits

- **The scale benchmark's two growth assertions stay red.** The build grows
  15.48× from 2,000 to 10,000 vectors against a ceiling of 8×, and 50,000
  vectors take 1,018.05 s against a ceiling of 300 s. Those are the figures
  committed in
  [`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md);
  nothing here re-measures them, and closing either means cutting the
  distance-evaluation count itself.
- **Degree is unique-neighbour, and multiplicity is not in this release.**
  Topology stores a set, so a duplicate insert does not raise the count, and
  unresolved NULL targets stay outside the readout. A persisted per-pair insert
  count needs a write-ahead-log record that does not exist yet, and adding one
  would make a store written here unreadable by 0.6.8 — too much for a polish
  patch, so it moves to the next one.
- **HNSW search is still approximate unless you ask otherwise.** `exact=True`
  or a `where=` predicate force the exact GEMM path; `mask=` alone rides the
  widening beam. Approximate `VectorSimilar` rules still go through the index.
- **The MCP surface is still cooperative, with no auth.** Omitting the
  namespace roster from an unscoped `stats` removes a disclosure; it is not an
  access boundary. Real enforcement is the HTTP server's role tokens, where
  `GET /stats` is closed to them outright.

## v0.6.8 — sidecar exact reads

#### Added

- **`pairwise_similar` returns exact cosine top-k among a caller key set.**
  Self is excluded. Unknown keys, missing embeddings, zero-norm vectors and
  wrong-dimension vectors are skipped; empty-after-skip is `[]`. Dimension is
  the mode (ties pick the larger). Gram for n ≤ 4096, gemv through 8192 unique
  keys, then a `QueryError` that names the cap. Never HNSW. Pinned by
  `pairwise_similar_equals_naive_all_pairs`.
- **`find_similar` takes additive `where=` and `exact=`.** `where` is a
  property predicate (`field` plus `eq` or `in`); Python raises `ValueError`
  on an invalid dict, Rust `QueryError`. `where=` or `exact=True` skip HNSW
  and GEMM-brute the candidate set; `mask=` alone still uses the 0.6.7
  widening beam. MCP vector mode accepts both as optional arguments; edge
  mode ignores them; MCP default `min` stays 0.8. Pinned by
  `find_similar_where_eq_matches_key_list_mask` and `exact_true_skips_hnsw`.
- **`degree` and `degrees` read unique neighbour counts from CSR row length.**
  Duplicate inserts do not raise the count. Unknown key is `KeyNotFound`;
  unknown edge type is 0. `"both"` is out+in sum. `degrees` sorts degree
  descending, key ascending. Pinned by `duplicate_edge_does_not_increase_degree`.

#### Changed

- **Brute `find_similar` uses GEMM and returns the same scores as the scalar
  loop.** `matrixmultiply` 0.3, default features only. HNSW branches and the
  HNSW sort are untouched. Pinned by `gemm_brute_equals_scalar_on_256`.
- **Mixed-dimension candidates are skipped**, on GEMM and on the scalar
  helper, instead of a partial `zip` dot. Pinned by
  `mixed_dim_candidate_is_skipped`.
- **Brute sort is similarity descending, then key ascending.** The key-asc
  tie-break is new on the brute path only; HNSW sort stays as it was.

#### Known limits

- **Unique degree is not row-count multiplicity.** Topology stores a set
  (`add_edge` returns false on a duplicate). Unresolved NULL targets stay
  outside this readout.
- **The HNSW path is unchanged and still approximate.** `exact=True` or
  `where=` force GEMM; `mask=` alone does not. Approximate `VectorSimilar`
  rules still go through the index.
- **MCP listing is unchanged.** `ASSOCIATION_TOOLS` is still the same fifteen
  tools in the same order. No `pairwise_similar` tool, no HTTP `find_similar`.

## v0.6.7 — the hardening patch

#### Fixed

- **`serve` advances an outstanding build after a restart without waiting for a
  write.** A snapshot taken mid-build carries `complete == false` on its HNSW
  blob; opening the store registers that rule so the 1-second ticker has
  something to pump. Pinned by `a_reopened_store_pumps_its_outstanding_build_without_a_write`.
- **A reopen after a killed build slices the remainder**, rather than inserting
  it in one pass under the write lock. The open-time scan still inserts a
  handful of vectors written after a *complete* snapshot; an incomplete blob is
  left to `pump_index_build`. Pinned by `an_interrupted_build_resumes_on_reopen`
  and `a_search_after_a_mid_build_reopen_is_exact`.
- **`upsert_entity` refuses the whole update or applies all of it.** The update
  path used to set one property at a time, so a write refused partway — a
  different `ns`, a reserved name — left the properties ahead of the refusal
  committed. Every per-property check now runs first and the sets land in one
  WAL commit. The v0.6.6 known limit is closed. Pinned by
  `upsert_entity_update_is_all_or_nothing`.
- **`MERGE` creates inside a single-namespace role's namespace.** A role bound
  to exactly one namespace no longer has its MERGE create arm land in `default`
  (which it cannot write). When the pattern does not name `ns`, the create
  stamps that namespace. A role bound to two or more namespaces is still
  refused (`role-bound token: MERGE create requires the role to name one namespace`)
  unless the pattern names one. Pinned by
  `merge_creates_inside_a_single_namespace_role`.
- **A masked approximate search returns `k` hits.** `find_similar_vector_masked`
  and the masked MCP `find_similar` used to over-fetch from the store-wide
  index and stop, so a tenant whose nearest neighbours were mostly other
  tenants' nodes got a short result. The beam now starts at an over-fetch of
  `k` divided by the mask's selectivity, doubles until it has `k` visible hits
  or reaches `EF_MAX` (the same cap an exact `VectorSimilar` rule uses), and
  at the cap falls back to an exhaustive masked scan. Nothing leaks; the
  result is no longer short. Pinned by
  `a_masked_search_widens_its_beam_until_it_has_k` and
  `a_masked_search_at_the_beam_cap_falls_back_to_the_scan`.

#### Changed

- **A single-namespace role's `MERGE` create is new behaviour.** Under 0.6.6
  the same statement was refused; now it writes into that namespace.
- **The CI bench baseline is re-taken at 0.6.6.** The `bench` job now
  compares against run `34880373108` (`ubuntu-latest`, 2026-09-14).

#### Known limits

- **`stats` over MCP answers with every namespace name unless it is asked to
  narrow.** The MCP server is a cooperative surface with no auth, so `stats`
  reports the full roster by default and narrows only when given `role` or
  `namespace`; the store-wide counts beside the roster are unchanged either
  way. A tenant that must not learn the other tenants' names belongs behind
  `serve --role-token`, where HTTP `GET /stats` is closed to role tokens
  entirely.
- **A refused or parked vector is re-derived on reopen rather than persisted.**
  `dim_mismatches` and the parked list are not in the blob; what restores them
  is the open-time node scan, which re-offers every vector the persisted graph
  lacks and gets the same refusals. The state is therefore rebuilt rather than
  remembered, which `a_refused_vector_is_still_refused_after_a_reopen` and
  `a_parked_vector_survives_a_reopen` pin at store level.
- **The scale benchmark's two growth assertions stay red.** The build grows
  15.48× from 2,000 to 10,000 vectors against a ceiling of 8×, and 50,000
  vectors take 1,018.05 s against a ceiling of 300 s. The figures, and the
  evaluation-count gate that watches the same thing as a machine-independent
  count, are in
  [`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md).

## v0.6.6 — the scale release

The vector index was the ceiling. Opening a store rebuilt the HNSW graph it had just loaded, a
changed embedding cost a walk of the whole graph, `create_rule` over a large corpus held its commit
for the length of the build, and an exact `VectorSimilar` rule still compared every pair. This
release takes those four in turn and then replaces the distance kernel underneath them, which is
where most of the speed comes from. It also adds namespaces, so one store can hold several tenants
and a role can be bound to theirs. Every number below comes from a benchmark or a gate this
release commits; the full printed table, and which of its columns are within-0.6.6 comparisons
rather than comparisons with 0.6.5, are in
[`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md).

#### BREAKING

- **A store written by 0.6.6 cannot be opened by 0.6.5.** `RuleDef` gains an appended `namespace`
  field. A rule persisted by 0.6.5 still decodes here, as a global rule; the reverse does not
  hold — 0.6.5's decoder knows only the older shapes and rejects trailing bytes, so it fails with
  `rule_def deserialize` and the open is refused rather than degraded. Every rule 0.6.6 snapshots
  is re-encoded this way, including rules 0.6.5 itself created. **Roll back only from a snapshot
  taken before the upgrade.** Pinned by `a_0_6_5_decoder_cannot_read_a_0_6_6_rule`.
- **The persisted vector index is blob version 3 (`MHNS`), and the upgrade is one way.** A 0.6.6
  binary reads version 1, 2 and 3 blobs and writes version 3. A 0.6.5 binary meeting a version-3
  blob refuses *the blob* and falls back to a full scan — correct and slower — but it will not get
  that far on a real store, because the `RuleDef` line above refuses the open first. The snapshot
  format itself is untouched; see "Not in this release".
- **`create_rule` on a large vector corpus returns before its edges exist.** A rule whose vector
  index does not fit in one build slice is installed, reports its progress through `stats`
  (`building: {indexed, total}`) and `POST /rules` (**202 Accepted**), and derives its edges in a
  second commit once the index is whole — never a partial set, and no search answers from the
  partial index either (see Fixed). A write advances the build, `mushroomdb serve` advances a build
  its handle has registered once a second, and `mushroomdb build-index <db>` drives it to
  completion. **After a restart the first write or `mushroomdb build-index` is what registers an
  outstanding build** — a freshly opened `serve` has nothing to advance until then. A corpus at or
  below the slice size behaves exactly as it did before, and this applies to a `VectorSimilar` rule
  in **either** mode, not only an approximate one: the slice threshold is the vector index, which
  both build.
- **An exact `VectorSimilar` rule finds its candidates through the vector index.** Its scores and
  weights are still computed exactly, on those candidates; the rule's `min` is the beam's stopping
  rule, and a beam that cannot prove that floor widens until it can or falls back to the exhaustive
  candidate set. What changes is that the candidate set is no longer provably every pair: the
  committed gate `exact_vector_rule_recall_5k` asserts recall ≥ 0.98 against a brute-force ground
  truth at 5,000 vectors, and measures 1.0. `MUSHROOMDB_VECTOR_SCAN=1` restores the full scan and
  the guarantee it carries, at O(n²).
- **`roles.json` version 4** is written when any role carries `namespaces`. An older binary refuses
  a version-4 file and denies every role, which is the safe direction but is a hard stop — roll
  roles forward only once every reader is on 0.6.6.
- **`ns` is a reserved property, and it is write-once.** A node's namespace is fixed at insert: a
  later write naming a different `ns`, and a property delete that would strip it, are both refused.
  A single write may name `ns` at most once — with two entries the write path and the authorization
  path could read different namespaces from the same list. Absent means the default namespace, so
  a store with no `ns` property anywhere is one namespace and nothing is rewritten. **A store that
  already used `ns` as an ordinary string property is not**: those values become namespace names on
  the first 0.6.6 open, so those nodes leave the default namespace, `ns` stops being writable on
  them, and a value that is not a legal namespace name can end up listed by `stats` where no
  surface can pass it back. Rename the property before upgrading if it meant something else.
- **`MERGE` cannot create into a namespace, for any caller.** A MERGE pattern carries only its
  identifying property, so its create arm always lands in the default namespace — which means a
  role bound to namespaces cannot MERGE-create at all. Use `CREATE`, `insert_node` or `ingest`,
  which take `ns` like any other property.
- **An embedding whose dimension differs from the ones an index already holds is no longer
  indexed**, and the first skip per index is logged. Such a pair was previously compared over the
  shorter of the two vectors, which produced a meaningless similarity. An index that skipped a
  vector, or whose dimension is not the query's, stops claiming the fast path: the rule falls back
  to its full scan and `find_similar_vector` to brute force, so a mixed-dimension corpus costs
  speed, never results. A rule with `approximate: false` probes the same index and takes the same
  fallback, so its **results** are unaffected and its speed is not. Re-embed a collection with a
  single model.

#### Added

- **Namespaces.** A node carries a reserved `ns` property, set at insert and immutable afterwards;
  absent means the default namespace, so an existing store is one namespace and nothing is
  rewritten. A role may be bound to namespaces (`"namespaces": ["tenant-a"]`) and then sees only
  those — intersected with its labels, its keys and its `visible_where`. A rule is scoped
  (`"namespace": "tenant-a"`) or global; a scoped rule's edges never cross, and a user-written edge
  across a boundary is refused. `query`, `/query`, the CLI and Python take a `namespace`; `stats`
  reports per-namespace node counts; `as_of` composes with all of it.
- **`mushroomdb build-index <db-dir> [--rule <name>]`** — finish a deferred vector-index build
  before traffic arrives.
- **`MUSHROOMDB_HNSW_PARAMS`** — `m,m0,ef_construction,ef_search[,prune]`, read once per process,
  for an operator who has measured their own corpus. The shipped defaults and the measurements that
  chose them are in [`docs/site/rules.md`](docs/site/rules.md).

#### Changed

- **The index stores each vector as `f32` in one contiguous slab and sums the dot product in eight
  independent accumulators.** This is where the release's speed is, and it is what pays for the
  diverse-neighbour prune below. Measured across releases by the one gate that ran on both sides:
  `approximate_recall_5k_timing`'s HNSW backfill was **227 s on 0.6.5** (recorded in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` at tag `v0.6.5`) and is **49 s** here, at the same recall of 1.0.
  Measured within this release, before and after the kernel alone, a 1,536-dimension build takes
  8.5 s at 2,000 vectors and 132 s at 10,000 against 49.6 s and 731 s, and 50,000 vectors build in
  1,018 s where that size was never run at the earlier cost. The index holds 6,663 bytes per vector
  instead of 12,807 — 48 % less — and the persisted blob halves with it. Recall is unchanged on all
  six gates. The store's own `f64` copy of every vector is untouched; only the index's copy is
  narrowed, and every similarity a caller is shown is still computed from the `f64` properties.
  Every figure here, and which comparison each one is,
  is in [`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md).

#### Fixed

- **Opening a store no longer rebuilds the vector index it just loaded.** The open-time scan built
  a whole HNSW graph and then threw it away in favour of the persisted one. It now adopts the
  persisted graph and inserts only the nodes written after the snapshot.
- **A changed embedding no longer costs a scan of the whole index.** Removal walked every node in
  the graph to strip back-references; a reverse-adjacency map makes it O(in-degree), which
  `remove_is_not_a_full_scan` asserts as an operation count rather than a wall clock. At the
  shipped kernel one re-embed costs 2.4 ms at 2,000 vectors, 6.6 ms at 10,000 and 14.3 ms at
  50,000 — that is the cost after both this fix and the kernel, not a measurement of either alone.
- **A diverse-neighbour prune replaces the nearest-M one**, which is what the raised `M₀` was
  standing in for. It is a **first-rejection short-cut** of the HNSW paper's §3.5 algorithm, not
  that algorithm: it keeps the untested far tail where the paper backfills with the nearest
  rejects, which is both faster and — on a corpus whose clusters are wider than `M₀` — measurably
  better. `docs/site/rules.md` carries the comparison, and anyone "correcting" it toward the paper
  should read that table first. Parameters are now `HnswParams` with documented defaults and a
  `MUSHROOMDB_HNSW_PARAMS` override; the three recall gates already in CI pass unchanged, and four
  more join them. It costs build time at a fixed corpus size — 5,000 × 1,536 dimensions takes
  43.3 s with it against 9.6 s with the nearest-M prune — and the cheaper prune misses the 0.90
  recall floor on a clustered corpus at 0.8581, which is why the diverse one is the default and the
  other is an opt-out with its cost recorded beside it.
- **A search during a deferred build is answered exactly, not from the part of the index that
  exists.** The sliced build made `find_similar` and `hybrid_search` able to be *wrong* rather than
  slow for the first time: after `create_rule` returned 202 the graph held one slice, looked
  perfectly answerable, and was used — so a query whose true nearest neighbour sat outside that
  slice got the nearest of the slice instead, with nothing in the result saying so. On a quiescent
  embedded store that was permanent. Both paths now decline: a live handle skips a rule with a
  build outstanding, and a snapshot taken mid-build records the fact in its index blob so that a
  reader opening it declines too. Either way the caller gets the exhaustive answer, and the fast
  path returns when the build finishes.
- **`mushroomdb doctor`'s handshake waits as long as the store took to open.** The check spawns
  the MCP server, which has to open the same store `doctor` just opened — and a WAL-only store
  replays its vector rules' index builds every time, which can take longer than the fixed 10-second
  deadline the handshake used. `doctor` therefore reported a healthy server as unreachable,
  moments after its own open had taken longer than that without complaint. The deadline is now at
  least 10 seconds and otherwise twice the open it measured plus 5 seconds, and a handshake that
  still times out names the open time and points at `build-index` and `snapshot`.
- **`find_similar` reports an exact similarity again.** `find_similar_vector`,
  `find_similar_vector_masked` and the MCP `find_similar` tool re-score every candidate the index
  returns against the `f64` property vectors, so `min = 1.0` finds an exact duplicate and the index
  and brute-force paths return the same scores in the same order. Equal scores are broken by node
  key.

#### Known limits

- **`stats` over MCP answers with every namespace name unless it is asked to narrow.** The MCP
  server is a cooperative surface with no auth, so `stats` reports the full roster by default and
  narrows only when given `role` or `namespace`; the store-wide counts beside the roster are
  unchanged either way. A tenant that must not learn the other tenants' names belongs behind
  `serve --role-token`, where HTTP `GET /stats` is closed to role tokens entirely.
- **A refused or parked vector is re-derived on reopen rather than persisted.** `dim_mismatches`
  and the parked list are not in the blob; what restores them is the open-time node scan, which
  re-offers every vector the persisted graph lacks and gets the same refusals. The state is
  therefore rebuilt rather than remembered, which `a_refused_vector_is_still_refused_after_a_reopen`
  and `a_parked_vector_survives_a_reopen` pin at store level. A mixed-dimension index upgraded from
  a 0.6.5 or pre-kernel blob counts its padded positions as refusals for the same reason.
- **`upsert_entity`'s update path is not atomic.** It sets one property at a time, so a write that
  is refused partway — naming a different `ns` on an existing node, for instance — leaves the
  properties ahead of the refusal committed and returns an error. Send a single-property update, or
  use `POST /query` with a Cypher `SET`, when that matters.
- **A masked approximate search can return fewer than `k`.** `find_similar` under a role bound to
  namespaces over-fetches from the store-wide index and then filters by the mask, so a tenant whose
  nearest neighbours are mostly other tenants' nodes can get far fewer hits than a full scan would
  find. Nothing leaks; the result is short, not wrong. `MUSHROOMDB_VECTOR_SCAN=1` or an exact rule
  avoids it.
- **A full-authority edge upsert cannot auto-create an endpoint outside the default namespace.**
  The placeholder node it would create carries no properties, so it would land in the default
  namespace and the cross-boundary check refuses the edge. Create the endpoint first, with its
  `ns`.
- **`MERGE` has no way to name a namespace.** See BREAKING above; a role bound to namespaces must
  use `CREATE`, `insert_node` or `ingest` to create.
- **No test ties a documented refusal string to the code that emits it.** The namespace work adds
  about ten quoted refusal texts to `masks.md` and `api.md`, and `scripts/check-claims.sh` does not
  cover them, so a reworded error and its documentation can drift apart.
- **`docs/site/masks.md` and `docs/site/service.md` are not in the LLM bundle.**
  `scripts/gen-llms-full.sh` links both pages rather than concatenating them, so the namespace
  composition rules and the deployment page do not reach `llms-full.txt`. The same statements reach
  it through `api.md` and `mcp.md`.
- **Role-token `as_of` still replays the WAL under the store's read guard**, unchanged from 0.6.5,
  and the namespace leg composes into that same path. There is no rate limit.

#### Not in this release

No snapshot format change: V9 stays V9, and the `format-compat` contract (V5…V9 open, migrate and
preserve data) is untouched. The vector index rides the opaque section it already rode, with its
own magic and version inside it, so a 0.6.5 binary meeting a 0.6.6 index blob would fall back to a
full scan rather than read it wrongly — though on a real store it refuses the open first, for the
`RuleDef` reason under BREAKING.

The scale benchmark's two growth assertions stay red, deliberately and unedited: the build is
15.5× per 5× of vectors against a ceiling of 8×, and 50,000 vectors take 1,018 s against a ceiling
of 300 s. A constant-factor kernel cancels out of a ratio, so closing them means cutting the
distance-evaluation count itself, which changes the graph and therefore the recall table. That is
0.7's problem, and the benchmark says so rather than being loosened. The figures, and the
evaluation-count gate that watches the same thing as a machine-independent count, are in
[`benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md`](benchmarks/results/hnsw-scale-0.6.6.md).

A build in progress is paid for by writers: every durable write does one slice of it, which at
2,048 vectors of 1,536 dimensions is roughly 9–27 seconds under the write lock. A reopen mid-build
does not resume the slicing at all — the open-time scan finishes the whole remaining index in one
pass, and only the edge backfill is left to the slice loop. Run `mushroomdb build-index` before
traffic arrives rather than discovering either through latency.

## v0.6.5 — the knowledge-base release

A team running mushroomdb as a sidecar graph beside a document knowledge base wrote down what
stopped it becoming the primary store, and this release is that list, fixed. History expired
silently — automatic snapshots kept the newest eight WAL archives, and past that horizon a history
read answered as if nothing had happened. A snapshot cost roughly nine times the data it held,
because every string column carried its own copy of the string table. The two things the product
sells — time travel and per-caller visibility — refused to compose. Durability was self-managed,
with no page telling an operator what to mount or how to restore. And the 0.5.x data-loss bug
class — via-hop rules retracting all their edges after a snapshot — was still covered by
dogfooding rather than by a test. Each item is small, each has its own test, and every number
below comes from a test this release commits. There is no benchmark gate: nothing here is a claim
about agent performance.

#### BREAKING

- **Snapshot format V9 — one shared string table.** A snapshot carries the string table once, in a
  new section, instead of a full copy inside every string column. Measured by
  `snapshot_size_is_near_the_property_payload` (12,000 nodes × 8 string fields, 3.7 MB of property
  bytes): **36.8 MB → 5.2 MB** on disk, 9.82× the payload down to 1.39× (the 36.8 MB / 9.82× "before"
  figure is a pre-change measurement recorded beside the test, taken against the old per-column
  layout the V8 encoder wrote; the 5.2 MB / 1.39× "after" figure is what the committed test asserts,
  as `size < payload * 2`). Upgrading is automatic and
  in place — the first read-write open of a V5–V8 store rewrites its snapshot at V9 and keeps the
  old one as `snapshot.bin.bak` until the next clean open. **A store snapshotted by 0.6.5 cannot be
  opened by 0.6.4 or earlier**: an older binary refuses it with `snapshot: unsupported version 9`
  rather than reading it wrongly. The `.bak` is the only way back, so take a backup before
  upgrading a store you may need to downgrade.
- **`GraphError::CommitOutOfRange` gains `floor`.** The error names the range it will actually
  accept (`floor..total`) instead of claiming `0..total` on a store whose early commits have been
  pruned, and appends `— events before commit {floor} are not retained` when the floor is above
  zero. Rust callers matching the variant exhaustively add `floor` or `..`.
- **`GraphDb::node_history` returns `HistoryResult`**, matching `edge_history`:
  `{ items, total_commits, horizon }` instead of a bare `Vec`. `edge_history`'s result gains
  `horizon` in the same shape. Python's `db.node_history(key)` likewise returns a dict — migrate
  with `db.node_history(k)["history"]`.
- **Automatic snapshots keep every archive by default.** The eight-archive bound is gone: retention
  is something you configure (`mushroomdb snapshot <db> --retention N`), never something that
  happens to you. The consequence is that a store directory now **grows with churn until you prune
  it**; `mushroomdb stats` and `mushroomdb doctor` both print where history starts.
- **`roles.json` version 3** is written when any role carries `visible_where`. An older binary
  refuses a version-3 file and **denies every role**, which is the safe direction but is a hard
  stop — roll roles forward only once every reader is on 0.6.5.
- **`as_of` together with `stub_hidden` is refused** on `POST /query` and on the MCP `query` tool
  (400 / tool error, `as_of (time-travel) does not compose with stub_hidden`). The combination was
  previously accepted with the flag silently inert.
- **`RoleDef` gains a public field `visible_where`.** Rust callers building a `RoleDef` with a
  struct literal add the field (or `..`).
- **`Stats` gains a public field `history_floor`.** Rust callers building a `Stats` with a struct
  literal add the field (or `..`).
- **`AUTO_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` changes type from `u32` to `Option<u32>`.** `None` is the new
  keep-everything default; a Rust caller reading the constant matches the new type.

#### Added

- **Time travel composes with roles and masks.** `POST /query` with `as_of` and a role token or a
  client mask is no longer refused, and the MCP `query` tool takes `as_of`. The engine surface is
  `GraphDb::query_at_scoped(commit, cypher, params, scope)` with
  `AsOfScope::{Role, Keys, RoleAndKeys}`; both masks are resolved on the temporal handle, so a role
  and a client allow-list intersect at the commit being read and neither can widen the other. Three
  semantics are worth knowing: the **graph is historical but the role definition is current**,
  because `roles.json` is a sidecar with no past version, so narrowing a role today changes the
  answer to yesterday's question; **deletion is not retroactive** — a role reads a now-deleted node,
  and its edges, at any retained commit where it was live, so revoking history means pruning
  archives or narrowing the role, not `DELETE`; and **keys resolve by string at the commit being
  read**, so a key reused after a rename names whichever node held it then.
- **Predicate masks.** A role may carry `visible_where: {field, eq | in}` beside `labels`, so "this
  reader sees published documents" is a role rather than a key list. Equality and membership only;
  a missing property fails the predicate; `keys` grants are never narrowed by it; a predicate
  without at least one label is refused. Values may be written as plain JSON scalars
  (`"in": ["published", "archived"]`) or in the graph's tagged form, mixed within one list; the
  server writes the tagged form back. A resolved mask is memoised per commit sequence, so a scoped
  reader pays for it once per write rather than once per call, and a role edit installs a fresh
  memo rather than clearing the old one.
- **`mushroomdb serve --restore-from <dir>`** seeds an empty store directory from the newest backup
  under `<dir>` (an immediate `latest/` subdirectory wins outright, otherwise newest by mtime), and
  does nothing when the directory already holds a store — safe to leave in a container command line
  forever. The copy is staged inside the target directory and opened before anything is installed,
  so **a failed restore changes nothing**: a corrupt backup leaves the store directory exactly as it
  was found, and the next boot restores rather than reporting a half-written store. New page:
  [Running it as a service](docs/site/service.md) — what to mount, how often to snapshot, how to
  back up, how to restore, and what a restart without a volume costs.
- **A snapshot round trip per rule kind** — ten cases covering every predicate (`KeyMatch`,
  `FieldEqual`, `Overlap`, `NumericWithin`, `GeoRadius`, `VectorSimilar`, `All`, `Any`) plus the
  via-hop and two-rule-chain shapes, each asserting that derived edges survive a reopen *and* that a
  write after the reopen retracts exactly the right subset and no more. This is the class of bug
  0.5.x shipped; reverting the 0.6.0 fix makes the two via-hop-shaped cases fail.

#### Fixed

- **Every history read reports the horizon.** `node_history` and `edge_history` carry `horizon`, the
  oldest commit still retained, on the Rust, HTTP, MCP and Python surfaces; `was_linked`, `edges_at`,
  `asof` and `query_at` name the valid range in their error. `Stats` gains `history_floor`, and
  `mushroomdb stats` prints a `history:` line — `complete (nothing pruned)` or `reaches back to
  commit N`. No read answers "nothing happened" when the answer is "that is no longer retained".
- **`mushroomdb asof` reported the wrong total** on any store with WAL archives; it counted only
  live `wal.bin` frames, so an eleven-commit store printed `of 1`. It now prints the real total and
  names the horizon floor.
- **A clean-open store answers approximate vector queries from its persisted index before the first
  write**, instead of scanning every embedding (results were already exact either way; every earlier
  release brute-forced here). The first write then releases the read path's copy of that index
  instead of holding it for the life of the handle.
- **The open adopts a snapshot's persisted vector index before scanning nodes**, so an embedding the
  scan sees but the index predates is added to the index rather than dropped. On 0.6.5 as shipped the
  case was masked by the write hook re-filing the node; the ordering is now correct on its own.
- **Opening a store with an approximate vector rule no longer rebuilds the HNSW index the snapshot
  already holds.** The open path built every approximate rule's graph from scratch and then replaced
  it wholesale with the persisted blob; it now loads the blob and skips the build. A rebuild is the
  fallback for a rule with no persisted index or one whose persisted index fails to load, and a
  failed load says so on stderr rather than leaving an empty index. The same build-then-discard
  shape was removed from every `what_if` call.
- **The shared string table is validated, not trusted.** The fuzz-safe decode path reaches the new
  section through checked `rkyv` access, the structural pass behind `mushroomdb verify` covers it,
  and a smashed pointer inside it decodes as `Corrupt` instead of resolving out of bounds.

#### Known limits

- **Role-token `as_of` replays the WAL under the store's read guard.** `query_at_scoped` reopens
  from disk on every call, exactly as `query_at` already did, but the surface is now reachable by a
  role token — so a role-token client can drive repeated replays. There is no rate limit.
- **`docs/site/masks.md` is not in the LLM bundle.** `scripts/gen-llms-full.sh` links the masks page
  rather than concatenating it, so the predicate-mask and as-of-composition sections do not reach
  `llms-full.txt`. The same statements do reach it through `api.md` and `timetravel.md`.
- **A cold predicate resolve is linear in the allowed labels.** Resolving a narrowed role scans every
  node of every allowed label and reads one property each; no property index is consulted. The memo
  hides this between writes, so a write-heavy store with a large label set pays it once per commit.

## v0.6.4 — the data-layer release

No engine change, no tool added or removed, no format change. This release is the product saying
what it is: the data layer for agents that reason over entities — rules that derive and retract
relationships, `explain_association` with the evidence, `edges_at` for the graph as it was,
`what_if` for a change not yet made, and `query` by `role` — served over MCP or embedded. The
code-graph door is deprecated: it still works, it is still tested, it is off the front door, and
0.7 removes it.

#### Why, measured

The code door's pre-registered gate was evaluated in full and failed on every arm
([`results/20260910T000418Z`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260910T000418Z/summary.md), 240
cells): the invoked arm scored 0.924 against stock's 0.927 (`-0.0035 [-0.0112, 0.0017]`) and cost
$0.2713 against $0.2267 (`+0.04463 [+0.01312, +0.07471]`), and the two installed-but-not-invoked
arms made **0 graph calls across 120 sessions**. The association suite measures the engine instead:
the graph arm moved from 0.795 / $0.5089 to 0.967 / $0.0923 against the relational baseline's 0.974
/ $0.1158 — a correctness tie at a lower mean cost — and files + grep remain the cheapest way to
answer those twenty questions on a 2,000-entity world
([`results/20260911T065400Z`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T065400Z/summary.md)).

#### Changed

- `README.md` and `docs/site/index.md` lead with the entity data layer. `ingest-git` is documented
  as a **data source** — commits, pull requests, files and authors as entities with rule-derived
  relationships — rather than as the product.
- The `/mushroom` skill and the Cursor rules file answer one named call per question kind on an
  entity store. The rows telling an agent to call the graph before a search are gone.
- The Claude Code plugin's description leads with graph memory.
- Every "faster coding" / "fewer tokens" claim is removed from README, the docs site, `llms.txt`,
  `llms-full.txt` and the plugin description, and `scripts/check-claims.sh` keeps them out in CI.
- The publish smoke expects the entity surface.

#### Deprecated — still working, still tested, removed in 0.7

- **The code task tools** `explore`, `map`, `context`, `impact`, `owners`, `why`, `sync`. Listings
  are unchanged: three on a store built by `ingest-git`, fifteen on any other, 27 served either way
  and all of them through `mushroomdb mcp <db> --all-tools`. If you call them, pin
  `mushroomdb@0.6.x` — nothing on the entity surface replaces them.
- **The three experimental hooks** `--intercept-grep`, `--impact-before-edit`, `--enrich-grep`.
  `install` now prints `deprecated  <flag> — the code-graph hooks are deprecated and are removed in
  0.7` for each. Re-run `install` without the flag to take one back out.
- **The plugin's coding-assistant positioning.** The plugin is not going away.
- **The code benchmark suite.** `run.py --suite code` still runs; no further runs are committed, and
  the committed summaries stay as the record.

Nothing in this release removes anything. The `code-graph` CI acceptance job still runs, because a
deprecated feature that still ships is one that still has to work.

## v0.6.3 — the association release

A release about the question the graph is supposed to be best at: *why are these two things
related, and what did that look like on some other day.* A new benchmark suite asks it — one
generated world written three ways, twenty relationship questions, graded against executable
truth — and the first run of it **failed its gate**, badly. Everything below is what that run
exposed, fixed: an `explain_association` that names the values two nodes actually share, a
`node_edges` that answers "why" in the call that lists the edges, two new tools (`edges_at`,
`what_if`) that answer a whole question in one call instead of twenty, and the Cypher spellings
an agent assumes exist and used to discover by parse error. The "before" measurement is reported
here as it came out. No format change.

#### Measured on the association suite (before the fixes)

The suite is `benchmarks/agent-tasks/` run with `--suite association`: one deterministic world
(seed `20260910`, scale 2000, a 90-day window and 300 changes) written three ways — `files/` as
`entities/*.json` + `changes.jsonl`, `sqlite/` as `world.sqlite`, `graph/` as a mushroomdb store —
and 20 questions over five kinds (why, multihop, retraction, timetravel, visibility), four each.
The arms are **P** (files + grep), **Q** (the relational file, and the baseline), **R** (the store,
reached only through the MCP server). Every arm gets `Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Edit,Write`; R also gets
`mcp__mushroomdb`. The §1 gate: correctness at or above arm Q paired by task, at or above every
other arm's paired mean, cost at or below arm Q, the 95% interval of the paired cost difference
against Q lying entirely below zero, and no max-turns failure on a task Q finished. Correctness carries no interval requirement —
Q saturated it in the pilot — so cost is the discriminator. Adoption is recorded, not gated: in
arm R the store is the only data path.

The verdict of the "before" run,
[`benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T005749Z/summary.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T005749Z/summary.md)
— arms P, Q, R × 3 reps × 20 tasks, 180 cells, world digest `f2b689ba52c80241`:

| | |
|---|---|
| verdict | **FAILED** |
| best arm | R |
| arms under the gate | R |
| cells with no cost recorded | 0 of 180 |

Why it failed:

- R: correctness -0.191 vs arm Q, paired over 20 task(s)
- R: correctness -0.191 is below arm(s) P (+0.013)
- R: cost 0.5089 > arm Q 0.1257
- R: cost interval [+0.2522, +0.5253] vs arm Q is not entirely below zero
- R: max-turns on tasks [5, 8, 14, 15, 16] where arm Q succeeded

| metric | P (files + grep) | Q (relational) | R (graph) |
|---|---|---|---|
| score | 1.000 | 0.987 | 0.795 |
| cost $ | 0.1050 | 0.1257 | 0.5089 |
| total tokens | 202216 | 226711 | 935776 |
| tool calls | 5.88 | 6.52 | 25.17 |
| turns | 6.88 | 7.52 | 25.55 |
| seconds | 45.7 | 60.3 | 159.1 |
| adoption | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

Paired by task, with a 95% percentile bootstrap over the per-task differences (2,000 resamples,
seeded), arm R against arm Q: score `-0.1914 [-0.3420, -0.0699]`, cost `0.38314 [0.25218,
0.52528]`, total tokens `709065.6 [498965.9, 914119.2]`, turns `18.033 [11.483, 25.667]`. Read
plainly: the graph arm was **worse and four times more expensive** than a single relational file,
and five tasks ran out of turns that Q finished. Adoption was 100% by construction, so nothing here
is a question of whether the agent reached for the graph — it reached for it 1,178 times and still
lost. The tool calls that dominated were `query` ×612 and `edge_history` ×222: an agent
replaying history event by event because no call answered the question whole.

The **code-door arms L, J and H** — arm B's install plus `--impact-before-edit`, plus
`--enrich-grep`, plus `--always-load` respectively — are wired into the harness in this release
but **carry no measurement**: no run of them is committed, so nothing here claims anything about
what those three hooks are worth.

#### Measured after the fixes

The same suite, the same world digest `f2b689ba52c80241`, the same three arms × 3 reps × 20 tasks,
180 cells:
[`benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T065400Z/summary.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T065400Z/summary.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| verdict | **FAILED** |
| best arm | R |
| arms under the gate | R |
| cells with no cost recorded | 0 of 180 |

Why it failed:

- R: correctness -0.007 vs arm Q, paired over 20 task(s)
- R: correctness -0.007 is below arm(s) P (+0.026)
- R: cost interval [-0.0581, +0.0115] vs arm Q is not entirely below zero

| metric | P (files + grep) | Q (relational) | R (graph) |
|---|---|---|---|
| score | 1.000 | 0.974 | 0.967 |
| cost $ | 0.0949 | 0.1158 | 0.0923 |
| total tokens | 200034 | 221063 | 186215 |
| tool calls | 5.90 | 6.38 | 4.00 |
| turns | 6.90 | 7.38 | 5.07 |
| seconds | 29.1 | 35.2 | 21.7 |
| adoption | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

Paired by task, with a 95% percentile bootstrap over the per-task differences (2,000 resamples,
seeded), arm R against arm Q: score `-0.0070 [-0.0711, 0.0483]`, cost `-0.02355 [-0.05815,
0.01148]`, total tokens `-34848.5 [-96315.1, 33715.3]`, turns `-2.317 [-4.000, -0.483]`. Arm P
against arm Q: score `0.0264 [0.0040, 0.0639]`, cost `-0.02094 [-0.02861, -0.01260]`, total tokens
`-21029.5 [-38685.4, -2746.6]`, turns `-0.483 [-0.933, 0.017]`.

The run measured commit `bbaa919`. The commits after it up to the release commit are docs, the
version bump, the gate wording, the brief's hard byte cap and its as-of note, `count(DISTINCT r)`,
and the `listed`/`label`/`neighborhood`/unknown-type fixes — none of them changes a tool this run
exercised, except the brief's as-of note. Against the "before" run the graph arm moved from score
0.795 to 0.967, cost $0.509 to $0.092, turns 25.6 to 5.1, max-turns cells 8 to 0, and errors 8 to 0.
Read plainly: the graph arm now ties the relational baseline on correctness and is cheaper in mean
cost, turns and wall time — but the pre-registered gate is still not met, because two rep-1
time-travel cells scored 0 (the agent chose a wrong commit for the date; see
[`classification.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260911T065400Z/classification.md)) and the
cost interval's upper end sits just above zero. The files + grep arm remains the cheapest and most
correct way to answer these twenty questions on this 2,000-node world.

#### The association surface — fifteen tools on a memory store

- **A store that was not built by `ingest-git` now lists the association surface.** Fifteen tools:
  `query`, `explain_association`, `neighborhood`, `node_info`, `node_edges`, `was_linked`,
  `edges_at`, `what_if`, `node_history`, `edge_history`, `find_similar`, `hybrid_search`,
  `remember`, `recall`, `stats`. A code-graph store still lists three (`explore`, `query`,
  `stats`). All **27** stay served on either surface — the listing decides what a session can
  call, not what the server answers — and `mushroomdb mcp <db> --all-tools` lists the whole set
  with schemas. The server decides once, at startup, from the store it opened, so one `.mcp.json`
  serves both kinds.
- **`query` takes a `role`.** Pass `role: "<name>"` to answer as one role from the store's
  `roles.json`: its label and key selectors resolve to the same allow-list `mask` takes. Pass one
  or the other, never both. Like `mask`, it is cooperative and never a security boundary.

#### `explain_association` answers with the evidence

- **The reply is text first, and it names the values the two nodes share.** Each relationship is
  one line — edge type, rule, score, the predicate it matched — followed by a bracketed clause
  carrying the evidence: `overlap` prints the shared list items, `field_equal` the equal value,
  `key_match` the destination key the field named, `geo_radius` both coordinates and the distance,
  `numeric_within` the two numbers, `vector_similar` the cosine the rule scored. A composed
  `all`/`any` prints one clause per branch. On the real association store the whole reply is 562
  bytes, and the values only one node holds never appear in it — which is the point: the old reply
  named a predicate and left the agent to fetch both property lists and diff them by hand.
- **Each predicate's own threshold is applied before anything is reported.** `overlap` must clear
  its `min` as a Jaccard ratio, `numeric_within` its tolerance, `geo_radius` its radius, and
  `key_match` only reports when the source field actually names the destination. Under `any`, only
  the satisfied branches print.
- **`json: true` gains an `evidence` object per relationship** — `{field, shared:[…]}`,
  `{field, value}`, `{field, a, b, km}`, `{field, a, b}`, `{field, similarity}` or `{parts:[…]}`.
  Every other field of the array is byte-identical to before.
- Two deliberate silences: a via-hop rule reports no evidence (its predicate was evaluated between
  the via node and the destination, not between the two keys asked about), and a `vector_similar`
  nested inside `all`/`any` reports no similarity, because a branch's own score is not recoverable
  from a min or a max.

#### Relationships in one call — `node_edges` and `neighborhood`

- **Both are text first, grouped by edge type with a count, each listed edge carrying its
  direction, the rule that derived it, its score and the predicate it matched.** "Why is this
  here" is answered in the same call that lists it, so no follow-up explain is needed. `json: true`
  returns `{key, total, listed, types: [{edge_type, count, listed, edges: […]}]}`.
- **`all_of: [types]` answers the intersection question in partner keys.** Only the partners linked
  to `key` by *every* one of the listed types, sorted, comma-separated, wrapped at 100 columns.
  On the benchmark's own hub node this is 302 bytes and one call against 114 KB of JSON or ~280
  pairwise probes. `json: true` → `{key, all_of, partners, listed, total}`.
- **`edge_type: T` gives one type's partner keys with the rule named once** rather than repeated
  per line; `json: true` → `{key, edge_type, rule, edges, partners, listed, total}`.
- **`label: L` narrows the partners** — and the counts, not only the listings — in every form, so
  "which *companies*" is one call rather than a key-prefix filter afterwards.
- **`direction: out | in | any`** (default `any`; `both` is a synonym) filters the edges the
  grouped view groups and the intersection is taken over. It was previously parsed and ignored by
  the grouped `edges_at` path.
- **`limit`** is 10 per edge type in the grouped view (max 100) and 200 partner keys under
  `edge_type`/`all_of` (max 2,000); the remainder is always stated as `… and N more`. The grouped
  listings still stop at 40 lines, and now say so: `… listing capped at 40 lines; pass edge_type
  or all_of for the whole set`.
- `all_of` together with `edge_type` is a tool error — `pass one of all_of or edge_type, not
  both` — rather than one of them silently winning.
- **An edge type that is nowhere in the store is a tool error naming it and the types the store
  does have**, capped at twenty names, rather than the "0 edges" / "0 partners" a misspelling used
  to answer — which reads as a fact about the graph and is indistinguishable from the right answer
  for a type this node genuinely has none of. The census only runs when the answer came back empty.
- **`neighborhood` takes `label` too**, and applies it: at depth 1 it narrows the partners and the
  counts exactly as `node_edges` does, and past one hop it keeps the traversal rows of that label.
  It used to be accepted and silently ignored. The walk itself is never narrowed — a hop through
  another label is how a two-hop question reaches the label it asked about.
- **The grouped `json: true` report carries a top-level `listed`** — the edges actually in the
  document, the sum of the per-type counts — and echoes the `label` it was narrowed by, which the
  other shapes of the reply already did.

#### New: `edges_at` and `what_if`

- **`edges_at(key, at, …)` is the graph as it was.** One WAL scan returns the edges a node had at
  commit `at` (0-based), each with the rule that had derived it. Renames are followed, so a node's
  current key finds edges written under an earlier name; a label is resolved against the live
  graph, which is the same answer at any commit because a label is fixed at insert. It takes the
  same `edge_type` / `all_of` / `label` / `direction` / `limit` arguments as `node_edges`, so "who
  was linked by all three of these on day 41" is one call.
- **`what_if(key, field, value, …)` answers before the change.** The rule engine runs the same
  re-derivation a real `set_prop` would, against a clone, and reports the derived edges that would
  be lost and gained with the rule behind each. **Nothing is written**: nothing on disk is copied,
  and the live graph answers the same way before and after. `edge_type` narrows counts as well as
  listings and prints both sides as partner keys; `label` narrows partners; `limit` (default 10,
  max 2,000) now applies to the grouped text too, and `json: true` carries `lost_total` /
  `gained_total` so a truncated report still says how much there was.
- **Engine**: `GraphDb::edges_at`, `GraphDb::what_if_set_prop`, `GraphDb::edge_type_census` and
  `GraphDb::wal_total_commits`.
- **Python**: `edges_at(key, commit)`, `what_if_set_prop(key, field, value)`, `edge_history(a, b)`
  and `wal_total_commits()`.

#### Cypher — the spellings an agent assumes exist

Every one of these used to be a parse error or a silent `null`, which is most of what the
benchmark's multihop cells burned their turns on.

- **`n.key` and `n.label` read as properties**, and `labels(n)` returns a one-element list. A
  stored property of either name still wins; this is only the fallback. They work in `WHERE`, in
  `ORDER BY`, in an inline pattern filter (`MATCH (c {key: 'c3'})`) and after a grouping `WITH` —
  the last of which was the deeper bug: `WITH c, count(*) AS n` used to flatten `c` to a scalar, so
  `c.key` read null and `key(c)` failed outright.
- **`STARTS WITH` / `ENDS WITH` / `CONTAINS`** as infix operators, desugaring to the scalar
  functions of the same meaning, so null and non-string handling is shared with the call spelling.
- **List subscripts** — `n.location[0]`, `[-1]` counting from the end. Out of range, a non-list
  base and a non-integer index are all `null`, never an error. Two unaliased subscripts of one list
  are now two named columns (`t.location[0]`, `t.location[1]`) instead of a duplicate-column error.
- **Comma-separated patterns in one `MATCH`** — `MATCH (t)-[:A]->(c), (t)-[:B]->(c)` — producing
  exactly what a run of separate `MATCH` clauses produces, so both spellings plan and execute
  identically. Patterns sharing no variable are a cartesian product, as openCypher says.
- **`count(DISTINCT …)` and `collect(DISTINCT …)`.** This is what makes an intersection correct:
  three edge types between one pair yield three rows per source under an alternation, and only
  `DISTINCT` counts it once. `count(DISTINCT *)` is a named parse error, and a variable actually
  named `distinct` still parses. On a **relationship** variable `count(DISTINCT r)` counts distinct
  edges, keyed on `(edge type, source, destination)`; it used to answer `0` on a graph full of them.
- **A non-aggregate `WITH … WHERE <alias>` resolves the alias.** `WITH t, t.x AS x WHERE x > 11`
  was a planner-only false rejection — the plan it refused to build would have run correctly.
- **An aggregate `WITH` with no `WHERE` now projects its `RETURN`.** `WITH c, count(t) AS n RETURN
  key(c), n` used to come back with columns named `c` and `n`, and a computed projection like
  `RETURN n * 2` was silently dropped.
- **An unknown function names itself** — the error quotes the name it did not know and lists the
  functions it does, instead of failing anonymously.

#### A memory store opens with its schema — `SessionStart`

- **`mushroomdb brief <db>` on a memory store prints the store's shape**: each label with its
  property names and node count, each edge type with the rule behind it, its source and
  destination labels and its count, the roles, the total commit count — and then one worked call
  per question kind, built from that store's own labels and edge types, so the calls are runnable
  as printed. The 4,000 bytes is a ceiling and not a line count: schema entries drop first, then
  every name is cut to 60 characters, and only then do the worked calls come off from the end
  under a final `(brief truncated at 4,000 bytes)` line. It is byte-stable between runs; a store too large to read
  inside the 3-second budget renders **partially** rather than late. The `embedding` field is
  hidden from the schema listing — 1,536 floats is not a property worth naming.
- **The recipes teach the one-call forms.** `why` names `explain_association` and says the reply
  carries the shared values; `relationships` and `as of` render the `all_of:` / `label:` form of
  `node_edges` and `edges_at` over edge types that actually run between the two busiest labels;
  `what if` appends the `edge_type:` narrowing; and a `linked by all of` recipe renders the
  comma-pattern, `count(DISTINCT …)` Cypher for the intersection question. The `as of` note says
  where its `at` comes from — no commit carries a date, so a date is turned into a commit number
  through `node_history` / `edge_history`, never guessed from the end of the WAL.
- **The skill carries a recipe per question kind**, and the `--delivery cli` variant names the CLI
  equivalent of each.

#### `install` — three more experiments, and always-load by default

- **`--impact-before-edit`** (off by default) adds a `PreToolUse` hook matched to
  `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`: before an edit lands it prints at most 600 bytes of the file's blast
  radius — importers, co-change partners, covering tests. It never blocks; exit 0 always.
- **`--enrich-grep`** (off by default) adds a `PostToolUse` hook matched to `Grep`: after a search
  returns it prints at most 800 bytes about the first five identifiers that name exactly one symbol
  the graph holds — definition site, caller count, the file's owner. Nothing resolving is nothing
  printed.
- **Both emit `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`** rather than bare stdout, which is the shape
  Claude Code adds to the model's context instead of showing to the user.
- **`--always-load` / `--no-always-load`.** `alwaysLoad: true` on the `mcpServers.mushroomdb`
  entry is now the **default for an entity-store install** — `--delivery mcp` or `both` with an
  explicit `--db` — because a session that cannot see the tools spends turns finding them. It is
  Claude Code's `.mcp.json` only, and it was verified honoured for a stdio server by Claude Code
  2.1.258. `--no-always-load` opts out; an install that named no store is unchanged.
- **`doctor` reports all of them**, and the install manifest records which are on, so `disable`,
  `enable` and `uninstall` handle them like every other hook.

#### The benchmark harness

- **`--suite association`** — the world builder (`association/build.py`, one generator and three
  writers that `equivalent()` checks agree), the truth module, 20 tasks over five kinds, arms P/Q/R,
  a paired percentile bootstrap, and a gate variant that requires the cost interval to exclude
  zero and does not gate on adoption.
- **`run.py --suite association --setup-only`** builds the three forms once (5–6 minutes) under the
  scratch directory; **`--reprovision`** takes the install off the graph subject so the next setup
  writes it again with the current binary, skill and brief, without touching the six-minute world
  or the digest `tasks.json` was written against.
- **Code-door arms L, J and H** (arm B's install plus `--impact-before-edit`, plus `--enrich-grep`,
  plus `--always-load`) and a real **`--disallowedTools`** switch, which removes a tool from what
  the model is offered — unlike `--allowedTools`, which only grants permission and leaves the tool
  in the list.

#### Fixed

- **`node_history` keeps the property events of a deleted node.** A node removed since the last
  truncating snapshot used to lose the history the WAL still held.
- **`what_if_set_prop` loads the base sections on a cold snapshot open** before cloning provenance,
  instead of reading an unpopulated clone.
- **`edges_at` resolves its key to the node's canonical current name**, so a renamed node's history
  is reachable by the key it has now.

#### BREAKING

- **The default MCP tool listing on a memory store is the fifteen-tool association surface.** Any
  store not built by `ingest-git` used to list a different set; a programmatic caller that
  discovers tools by listing rather than by name sees a different list. All 27 remain served and
  `--all-tools` lists them all.
- **`explain_association` replies with text, not JSON.** The rendered digest is the text content
  now; pass `json: true` for the array, which itself gains an `evidence` object per relationship.
- **`node_edges` and `neighborhood` reply with text, not JSON**, grouped by edge type with the rule
  and score per edge. `json: true` returns the grouped report.
- **`node_edges {key, edge_type, json: true}` changed shape.** It used to return the grouped
  `types[]` document; with `edge_type` it now returns the partner document
  (`{key, edge_type, rule, edges, partners, listed, total}`). Drop `edge_type` to keep the grouped
  shape. The HTTP `/node/{key}/edges` endpoint is untouched.
- **`edges_at {json: true}` lists at most `limit` edges per edge type** (default 10, max 100 in
  that form) and carries `listed` and `total` alongside `edges`, where it used to dump everything —
  114,092 bytes on the measured hub call against 7,266 now. Pass `edge_type` or `all_of` with a
  limit up to 2,000 for the whole set.
- **`what_if {json: true}` respects `limit`** (default 10) and gains `lost_total` / `gained_total`,
  where it used to return every edge.
- **The grouped `edges_at` view honours `direction`.** `out`, `in` and `any` were parsed and then
  ignored on that path, so every caller got the undirected answer; a call that passed a direction
  now gets the edges it asked for, and the counts in the header narrow with them.
- **`all_of` together with `edge_type` is a tool error** — `pass one of all_of or edge_type, not
  both` — on `node_edges` and `edges_at`, where one of the two used to win silently.
- **`alwaysLoad: true` is the default for an entity-store MCP install.** `install --delivery mcp`
  or `both` with an explicit `--db` writes it on the `mcpServers.mushroomdb` entry, so a re-run of
  `install` rewrites an existing `.mcp.json` that did not have it. `--no-always-load` opts out; an
  install that named no store is unchanged.
- **`WITH c, count(t) AS n RETURN key(c), n` now returns the columns it projects.** A query that
  was reading the columns named `c` and `n` out of that shape, or relying on a dropped computed
  projection, sees the projected names and values instead.

## v0.6.2 — the proof release

The delivery changes in this release were measured on a rebuilt agent benchmark before it shipped —
but *together*, not one at a time: one four-arm run of 240 cells, plus a one-rep probe of the two
`--intercept-grep` arms. No change here carries a number of its own, because the per-change
baseline run was cancelled. The pre-registered gate is reported as it came out. **The gate was not
passed.** Nothing here is a claim the numbers do not carry. No format change.

#### The gate

The benchmark is `benchmarks/agent-tasks/` (harness v2): 20 tasks over two repositories — this one
and a pinned third-party Python repository — graded against executable truth (a test command for
each change task, an exact answer key for the rest), one worktree per cell, cost and token counts
read from the session stream, and a `gate_verdict` computed by the harness rather than by hand.
The pre-registered §1 gate is: correctness >= stock (paired by task), cost <= stock, adoption
>= 80%, and no max-turns failure on a task stock finished.

The verdict is the Gate section of the full run,
[`benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260910T000418Z/summary.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260910T000418Z/summary.md)
— arms A, B, C, D × 3 reps × 20 tasks, 240 cells:

| | |
|---|---|
| verdict | **FAILED** |
| best arm | B |
| cells with no cost recorded | 0 of 240 |

**Gate not passed; best arm B; reasons: B: cost 0.2396 > stock 0.2267; B: adoption 0% < 80%;
B: max-turns on tasks [2, 3] where stock succeeded.**

The arms: **A** stock (no MCP, no skill), **B** installed (MCP + project skill + prompt hook, plain
prompt), **C** the same install with the prompt prefixed `/mushroom`, **D** `--delivery cli` (the
skill teaches the binary, no MCP server).

| metric | A (stock) | B (installed) | C (invoked) | D (cli delivery) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| score | 0.927 | 0.941 | 0.924 | 0.920 |
| cost $ | 0.2267 | 0.2396 (+5.7%) | 0.2713 (+19.7%) | 0.2290 (+1.0%) |
| total tokens | 514384 | 544632 (+5.9%) | 629814 (+22.4%) | 521363 (+1.4%) |
| tool calls | 13.27 | 13.02 | 14.02 | 12.20 |
| turns | 13.48 | 13.52 | 14.95 | 13.17 |
| adoption | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.43 | 0.00 |

Paired by task, with a 95% percentile bootstrap over the per-task differences, **no correctness
interval excludes 0** — B `0.0142 [-0.0083, 0.0508]`, C `-0.0035 [-0.0112, 0.0017]`, D
`-0.0067 [-0.0138, 0.0000]`. The one cost interval that excludes 0 is C's: `0.04463
[0.01312, 0.07471]`. Read plainly: on these tasks the graph changed nothing measurable about
whether the agent got the answer right, invoking it deliberately cost about 20% more, and nothing
but a deliberate invocation made an agent reach for it at all — 26 of 60 arm-C sessions made at
least one call (`query` ×45, `explore` ×43), and 0 of 60 in every other arm.

Two smaller runs are committed beside it, and neither is a gate:

- The **smoke after `explore`** (arms A, C × **1 rep** × the ten tasks on this repository),
  [`results/20260909T223250Z/summary.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260909T223250Z/summary.md):
  score 0.880 / 0.880, cost $0.2847 / $0.2385 (−16.2%), tool calls 18.60 / 12.80, adoption 0% / 40%.
  Gate FAILED (adoption 40% < 80%; C max-turns on task 3 where stock succeeded). **One rep.** Three
  reps of the same comparison erased that cost difference, which is the whole reason the full run
  exists.
- The **intercept-variant probe** (arms A, E, F × **1 rep** × all 20 tasks), where E is arm B and
  F is arm D with `--intercept-grep` added,
  [`results/20260910T050239Z/summary.md`](benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260910T050239Z/summary.md):

  | metric | A (stock) | E (installed + redirect) | F (cli + redirect) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | score | 0.871 | 0.891 | 0.924 |
  | cost $ | 0.2778 | 0.2397 (−13.7%) | 0.2369 (−14.7%) |
  | tool calls | 16.55 | 12.30 | 11.90 |
  | turns | 16.00 | 13.20 | 12.85 |
  | adoption | 0.00 | 0.25 | 0.10 |

  Gate FAILED (F: adoption 10% < 80%). **One rep — direction only, not a result.** The smoke above
  showed the same size of cost drop and three reps erased it.

#### A session opens with a brief — `SessionStart`

- **`mushroomdb brief <db>` and a third Claude Code hook.** The brief is the repository's shape read
  from the graph alone: file, symbol and edge counts, the sha of the last sync, the 25 most central
  files with their role, the 25 most called symbols with their signatures, and one line naming the
  door this install wired, under the same untrusted-data marker every digest rendered out of a
  store opens with — a brief is repository text placed in a session's context before its first
  turn, and the marker's bytes come out of the cap, not on top of it. Measured on this
  repository's store: **3,916 bytes** of a 4,000-byte cap, median **228 ms**. It reads no clock
  and no working tree, so two sessions started an hour apart get byte-identical output — a host
  that caches it is never wrong.
- **Key files are ranked by centrality and then filtered to files something imports or calls.**
  PageRank over the file graph alone put six `.woff2` font files and an `OFL.txt` in this
  repository's top 25; a file that only *co-changes* with code is not what a session needs to be
  oriented by. Files with no `IMPORTS`/`CALLS` edge are dropped after the ranking, so `brief` still
  starts with `map`'s key files. When the byte cap drops lines, the brief says `… and N more`
  rather than ending mid-list, and the reach line always survives the cap.

#### `explore` — one tool to find, and a listing that follows the store

- **New tool and subcommand `explore <target> [--depth context|impact|history|all] [--full]`.** It
  composes `context`, `impact` and `owners` behind one depth rather than adding a fourth report:
  `context` (default) is where the target is, its signature, call sites, callees, importers,
  partners and commits; `impact` adds the file's blast radius; `history` adds the owner and what the
  file changes with; `all` is all three. `budget` (MCP, in tokens; default 1,200 ≈ 4,800 bytes,
  minimum 200) caps the reply, and the header line naming the target survives any budget. Measured
  on this repository's store, replies run **2,070–3,488 bytes** across the four depths and three
  targets — the widest is 73% of the default budget — and `--depth all` has a median latency of
  **196 ms**, cheaper than `map`.
- **The MCP tool listing follows the store.** A store built by `ingest-git` advertises three tools —
  `explore`, `query`, `stats` — and any other store advertises eleven. The server decides once, at
  startup, from the store it opened, so one `.mcp.json` serves both and neither has to be configured
  for. Measured on this repository's store, the listing a coding session pays for before its first
  turn drops from **5,622 bytes to 1,593** — 72%, on top of the 12,238 → 5,622 cut in v0.6.1. All 25
  tools stay served on either surface — the listing decides what a session can call, not what the
  server answers — and `mushroomdb mcp <db> --all-tools` lists them all (14,419 bytes).
- **`doctor`'s handshake accepts either front door.** It required `map` in `tools/list`, which is
  exactly the tool a code-graph store no longer lists — `doctor` failed on the stores this feature
  exists for. It now accepts `explore` or `map` and names the one it found.

#### `context` answers with pointers; bodies are opt-in

- **The source body is no longer quoted by default.** `context` returns the line range
  (`path:start-end`), the signature and the doc, and `full: true` (`--full` on the CLI) adds the
  body read from the working tree. Measured on this repository's store: a symbol target **2,072
  bytes** against 3,853 with the body, a file target **1,640** against 4,044. The body is the
  expensive half of the answer and rarely the half that decides anything — and a file target now
  answers from the graph alone, reading nothing off disk.

#### The prompt hook fires on identifiers, and answers with pointers

- **`recall` is silent unless the prompt names an identifier** — a path, a `mod::name`, a snake_case
  or dotted name, an inner-capitalised word, or anything in backticks. `is it done`, `ok thanks` and
  `fix this` print nothing at all: no framing line, no header, dirty tree or not. The stopword list
  and relevance floor from v0.6.1 still apply on top of the gate.
- **The digest is pointers, not excerpts.** One line per hit — `path:line symbol — first doc line` —
  which is what a follow-up `explore` call takes as its target. The per-hit edge lines and the
  closing hint are gone, and the output budget drops from 1,800 to 1,200 bytes.
- **On a dirty tree the diff nudge replaces the digest** rather than printing beside it: a change in
  progress is the more useful subject.

#### `install --delivery cli|mcp|both`

- **The skill can teach the binary instead of a server.** `--delivery cli` writes the skill and the
  hooks and *no* `.mcp.json` entry, so a session loads no tool schemas before its first turn and
  reaches the graph through `Bash`: `mushroomdb explore <store> <target>`. `mcp` is the server
  alone; `both` (the default) writes the entry and a skill that also teaches the shell form.
  Switching an existing install to `cli` removes the entry it registered and prunes the manifest
  key. Claude Code only — a Cursor or Codex install is always the server, and `install` prints a
  note saying so rather than dropping the flag silently.
- **`doctor`, `enable` and `disable` follow the manifest.** A new `skip` status (never a failure)
  reports the `config` and `handshake` checks as `skip … delivery: cli`, per platform, while
  `store`, `lock`, `hooks`, `git-hooks` and `scope` still run against the store recovered from the
  recorded `SessionStart` hook. `enable` rebuilds the install that was disabled, server and all — or
  no server, as recorded.

#### `install --intercept-grep` (experimental, off by default)

- **A fourth hook that redirects a `Grep` for a known symbol to `explore`.** `PreToolUse`, matched
  to `Grep`: when the pattern is a bare identifier of three characters or more that the graph holds
  as a symbol, the hook exits 2 with one line pointing at `explore("<name>")`, and Claude Code hands
  the model that message instead of a list of matching lines. Anything regex-shaped, any name the
  graph does not hold, and any store that will not open pass straight through; the identifier test
  runs *before* the store is opened, so a regex search costs nothing. `disable`, `enable` and
  `uninstall` treat it like any other hook, and re-running `install` without the flag removes it.
  Arms E and F above are the only measurement of it, and they are one rep.

#### BREAKING

- **The default MCP tool listing now follows the store.** A code-graph store lists three tools
  (`explore`, `query`, `stats`); `map`, `context`, `impact`, `owners`, `why`, `recall`, `remember`,
  `sync` and `ingest_json` are no longer in its default listing. Every one of the 25 stays callable
  by name on either surface, and `mushroomdb mcp <db> --all-tools` lists them all with their
  schemas. A programmatic caller that discovers tools by listing rather than by name has to pass
  the flag.
- **`repograph` no longer re-exports `MAX_EDGES_PER_HIT` or `MAX_EDGE_CANDIDATES`.** The digest they
  bounded prints pointers now and has no per-hit edge lines to cap.
- **`recall_digest` takes the raw prompt.** It used to take an `or_query`-built search string;
  passing one now yields an empty digest, because the identifier gate runs on the text as the user
  typed it. It returns `""` before searching anything when the prompt names no identifier.
- **The `UserPromptSubmit` hook is silent on a prompt with no identifier, dirty tree or not.** The
  v0.6.1 behaviour of always printing a diff-aware nudge on a dirty checkout is gone.
- **`install` writes a new `SessionStart` hook** into `settings.json` (and the plugin ships it).
  An install that predates this release gains it on the next `install`; `uninstall`, `disable` and
  `enable` handle it like the other two.

## v0.6.1 — 2026-09-09

Dogfooding v0.6.0 on this repository turned up three code-graph defects, a token bill worth
trimming, and a worktree bug in `install`. All fixed here. No format change.

#### Fixed: three code-graph defects an agent benchmark caught

- **`Author.name` is the majority spelling, not the first one seen.** `ingest-git` used to label an
  author identity with whichever `%aN` its walk hit first and never revise it, so a name on the
  minority of commits could win permanently. `Author` nodes now carry `name_counts`, and `name` is
  the spelling on the most commits, ties going to the first seen. A store `ingest-git` wrote before
  this release has a `name` and no `name_counts`; the next sync walks the full log once to recover
  the real distribution and never pays for it again.
- **`context` and `why` list every call site, not one per caller symbol capped at eight.**
  `Symbol.call_lines` already recorded one entry per call site; the renderer read only the first and
  then truncated the list. Callers are now grouped by file and ranked by call-site count, with a
  `callers_not_shown` count when a very widely called symbol still needs cutting. Calls written
  inside a macro's arguments (`format!("… {}", sanitize(x))`) were never extracted at all — they are
  now. On this repository's own store: `CALLS` edges 8,778 → 9,857 from the extraction fix, and a
  caller list that was missing two whole crates (`crates/cli/src/recall.rs`,
  `crates/server/src/mcp_tasks.rs`) now names every one grep finds.
- **Call resolution got four narrower rules, cutting false edges 86% (10.5% → 1.2% of `CALLS`
  measured as non-test source calling into a test symbol):** a call written in method position
  (`x.name(`) no longer resolves through the guess-by-uniqueness tier — only same-file, same-
  directory, imported, or a repository-wide match that still carries its receiver type
  (`Store.flush`); a path call whose leading segment names nothing in the tree (`std::mem::take`,
  `serde_json::from_str`) resolves to nothing instead of guessing; the name-search tiers now require
  the definition to be in the same language as the call site (TypeScript/TSX/JS count as one
  family); and a Rust method call now gets incoming callers from receiver syntax at all — `0` such
  methods had a caller before this release, `222` do now, gated by a receiver check that requires
  `self`/`this`/`cls` or a variable named after its type, because the plain "type mentioned
  anywhere in this file" tie-break the brief specified produced ~2,700 wrong edges on this
  repository (`ResultSet.len`, `ColumnsView.get`) and was dropped rather than shipped.
- **`impact` and `why` name partners by shared-commit count, not only by the `CO_CHANGED` rule's
  similarity floor.** The floor (jaccard ≥ 0.25) is correct for the graph edge and stays unchanged,
  but it hides a file that changes with this one often and also changes a lot on its own —
  `crates/cli/src/lib.rs` shares 6 of `install.rs`'s commits and never cleared any floor worth
  setting. `impact` now fills remaining room with the most frequent partners at `≥ 3` shared
  commits, rendered `(N shared commits)` rather than a score so it can't be misread as one; `why`
  reports the same count whenever there is no direct edge.

#### Token diet — smaller replies, a smaller skill

- **Task tools reply with text only by default.** The `structuredContent` copy of every reply is
  gone. **Breaking for a programmatic caller:** pass the new `json: true` argument to get the report
  back as structured text instead of parsing `structuredContent`.
- **`tools/list` defaults to eleven tools** — the eight task tools plus `query`, `ingest_json` and
  `stats` — down from all twenty-four. Listing is the only thing that narrows: all twenty-four stay
  callable by name whichever listing is in force, and the skill names the thirteen unlisted ones so
  an agent can call one without seeing it in a list. `mushroomdb mcp --all-tools` lists the full set
  instead, including the sixteen `Advanced:`-prefixed graph tools from v0.6.0. The plugin's own MCP
  entry has no way to pass the flag; it does not need one.
- **`SKILL.md` shrank from 17.2 KB to under 6 KB.** The worked examples and the sixteen-row advanced
  table moved to `docs/site/code-graph.md`; what's left is the first minute, the task rules, the
  learn pass and one paragraph pointing at `--all-tools`, masks, and `no auth`.
- **`recall`'s prompt-submit nudge is silent on a generic prompt.** A stopword list (146 function
  words plus six code-generic ones — `code`, `file`, `line`, and the like) drops glue words from the
  search, and a relevance floor on the best hit means a prompt that resolves to nothing specific
  prints nothing rather than a low-value digest.
- **`impact` caps the `unknown:` paths it names at three**, then `…and N more unknown`, so an
  untracked-heavy working tree doesn't fill the whole reply with paths the graph has never seen.
  `json: true` still returns every one.

#### `mushroomdb enable` / `mushroomdb disable`

- **Toggle the integration off and back on without uninstalling.** `disable` removes the MCP entry,
  both Claude Code hooks, the git hook blocks and the Codex registration, but leaves the skill, the
  store and the `.gitignore` line alone; `disable` stashes the removed MCP entry so `enable` can
  bring it back, re-deriving the command fresh (so a package move between the two is picked up) and
  restoring an explicit `--command` pin verbatim if the binary still exists. `doctor` reports a
  disabled install with one line and exits clean.

#### The store resolves at run time — worktrees get their own

- **A project install writes `--auto` instead of an absolute store path** when it can prove `--auto`
  resolves to the same directory (a git checkout, no explicit `--db`). `--auto` now walks up to the
  nearest working-tree root rather than checking only the current directory, so a linked
  `git worktree` — which keeps its own `.git` file — resolves to its own `mushroom-memory` instead
  of inheriting the original checkout's. A 0.6.0 install with the absolute path still baked in is
  rewritten to `--auto` by the next `install`. Cursor and Codex don't set the environment variable
  Claude Code does to make this provable, so they still pin the absolute path; `--db` always pins.
  `recall`, `touch` and the git hooks' `sync` all take `--auto` the same way.
- **`install` run from inside a linked `git worktree` writes its git hooks where git runs them.**
  A worktree's `.git` file points at `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`, but git resolves hooks through
  the repository's **common** directory, so the three hooks landed somewhere nothing ever executed
  and `doctor` reported them present because it read the same wrong path. Both now follow the
  `commondir` file a linked worktree leaves beside its gitdir. A submodule has no such file and
  keeps its own hooks, which is what git does for it.
- **Hooks and the MCP entry call the resolved native binary directly instead of spawning `npx`.**
  Measured on this machine: `npx -y mushroomdb@<version> --version` 756 ms → the vendored binary
  invoked directly, 8 ms. `install` resolves the binary once (falling back to a `node <launcher>`
  form, then to `npx`, on any failure) and writes the resolved command everywhere; `--no-prewarm`
  skips the resolution along with the network fetch it replaces. The plugin's `hooks/run.sh` caches
  the resolved path per version under `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` (or `$HOME/.mushroomdb`; no caching at
  all with neither set, rather than a shared `/tmp` fallback) and re-checks it before every use. On
  a machine with no `npx` at all it now exits 0 in silence instead of printing `exec: npx: not
  found` before every prompt: the plugin cannot work without `npx` either way, and a hook body that
  prints on a machine it cannot serve is worse than one that says nothing.

#### Snapshots, and a narrower `touch`

- **`ingest-git` and `sync` snapshot automatically** — after a full ingest, and again once the live
  WAL has grown past 4 MiB — so a store opens against a small WAL instead of replaying everything
  since the last manual `snapshot`. Measured on this repository: store open 288 ms → 173 ms. `touch`
  never triggers one. Every automatic snapshot (this path, `serve`'s periodic tick, graceful
  shutdown, and a bare `mushroomdb snapshot` with no flags) archives the WAL it replaces rather than
  discarding it, so `node_history`, `edge_history`, `was_linked` and `open_at` keep reaching the
  folded history; only the explicit `mushroomdb snapshot --truncate` ends it there.
- **An automatic snapshot keeps the newest eight WAL archives.** Archiving moves the WAL aside
  rather than deleting it, so a store that snapshots on every sync would otherwise leave one more
  `wal.<N>.archive` behind per 4 MiB of churn and never reclaim any of them. The bound applies only
  to the snapshots mushroomdb takes on its own; `mushroomdb snapshot <db>` still keeps every
  archive, and `--retention N` sets the number. Pruning advances the history horizon — the reads
  above stop reaching commits below it, and `open_at` answers for commits after the last snapshot
  once the first prune has broken the `wal.genesis` chain. See `docs/site/durability.md`.
- **`touch` narrows its structure pass to the files it was actually given** instead of scanning
  every symbol in the repository, cutting the non-open cost of a one-file `touch` from about 6 ms to
  about 4 ms. Store open still dominates end-to-end time, which is why F5's snapshot change is the
  one that moves the number that matters.
- **The acceptance script's local `touch` budget is 250 ms**, up from 200, with a note that it
  guards the narrowed work rather than the store open; CI's 600 ms budget is unchanged.

#### Fixed: packaging test harness

- `packaging/tests/run.sh`'s npm-install happy-path check now serves fake release assets for the
  version it's actually installing (read from `packaging/npm/package.json`) instead of a hardcoded
  `0.1.0`, which had been 404ing and skipping every check after it since before this release.

#### Known

- **`snapshot.bin` is much larger than the data it holds.** Every string-typed column carries its
  own full copy of the store's string table, so an interned string is written once per column —
  37 MB for a store whose logical properties are under 4 MB on this repository. It costs more from
  this release on, because `ingest-git` and `sync` now snapshot on their own. The fix needs no
  format change and is the next release's first storage item.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-09-04

### The live code graph (format-stable)

No format change — snapshot VERSION stays V8 and WAL discriminants stay `0`–`22`. One new file
appears in a store directory: `LOCK`, always empty, carrying the advisory cross-process write
lock. Upgrade in place from any 0.4.x or 0.5.x store.

#### Fixed in this release (data loss in shipped 0.5.x)

- **Via-hop rules could retract all their edges after a snapshot.** The rule engine read topology
  from the write overlay only, so a via rule evaluated on a snapshot-opened store saw no via edges
  and retracted the ones already derived — `KNOWS` on this repository's own store went from 20
  edges to 1 after a snapshot followed by an incremental `ingest-git`. Fixed at the root; the
  graph produced through the snapshot path is now byte-identical to the graph produced without
  one.
- **A rule created immediately after a snapshot open now reindexes.** The "already indexed" flag
  was set per rule rather than per store load, so the first rule created on a freshly reopened
  store skipped its backfill.

#### Multi-process safety

- **An advisory cross-process write lock.** Every path that appends to the write-ahead log takes
  it first. `GraphDb::open` holds it for the handle's lifetime; `SharedDb` (the server) takes it
  per write scope and per group commit, so it never shuts other processes out between writes.
  `snapshot()` refuses without it.
- **`GraphError::Busy`** — the new error a writer gets when it cannot take the lock within
  `WRITE_LOCK_WAIT` (2 s). Nothing was written and no in-memory state changed, so a retry is
  always safe. CLI write commands exit **3** with `another mushroomdb process is writing; retry`.
- **`refresh()`** applies another process's committed WAL frames through the same code path the
  open replay uses, so rules fire and derived edges appear identically, and returns the number of
  commits applied. A partial trailing frame is left alone; a peer's snapshot triggers an in-place
  reload. **`is_stale()`** answers the same question with two metadata lookups and no file reads.
  `SharedDb::read()` calls it for you on every read, so a peer's completed commit is visible to
  the next read rather than to the next read after some interval.
- **`OpenOptions.read_only`** opens a handle that never takes the lock, writes nothing at open (no
  WAL repair write-back, no migration rewrite), returns `ReadOnly` from every mutation, and still
  refreshes. `mushroomdb recall` now opens this way, so the prompt hook cannot delay a writer or
  fail because one is running.
- **Known gap:** commits absorbed by `refresh` emit no subscription events, so `/watch` and
  `/subscribe` still see only writes made through their own process. The data is there on the next
  read; the notification is not. See [`docs/site/concurrency.md`](docs/site/concurrency.md).

#### The repository graph

- **New crate `mushroomdb-extract`** (`crates/code-extract`) — tree-sitter symbol, import and call
  extraction for Rust, Python, TypeScript, TSX and JavaScript, plus Markdown headings and
  mentions. Bytes in, facts out: it opens no file and touches no database.
- **`ingest-git` graphs structure, not just history.** The working-tree pass adds `Symbol` nodes
  and `IMPORTS`, `CALLS` and `MENTIONS` rules alongside the existing `CO_CHANGED` and `KNOWS`, and
  records each file's content hash. `--no-structure` and `--no-docs` opt out.
- **`--recurse-submodules`** walks each initialised submodule as its own sync unit, path-prefixed
  into one graph. **`--prs`** links merged pull requests through the `gh` CLI, and is skipped with
  a note when `gh` is missing or unauthenticated. **`--ensure-gitignore`** adds the store directory
  to the repository's `.gitignore`.
- **`.mailmap` is applied.** Author identity is read with `%aN`/`%aE`, so two addresses for one
  person collapse into one `Author` node.
- **`GitSync.synced_at`** records when a sync last ran, which is what `map` reports as
  `synced 3s ago at <sha>`.
- **Retraction extends to code.** An import you delete retracts its `IMPORTS` edge in the same
  write; a deleted file drops its derived edges; a renamed file carries its history to the new
  path. Orphaned symbols are swept before the file batches, so a rename frees its keys.

#### New commands

- **`mushroomdb map <dir> [--json]`** — the repository in one screen: size, last sync, file
  clusters with cohesion, most-depended-on files, owners, recently-hot files, and three questions
  worth asking. 17 lines on this repository.
- **`mushroomdb context <dir> <target>`** — one file or symbol from every side: signature, doc,
  source read from the working tree, owner, callers, callees, importers, co-change partners,
  recent commits, notes and concepts. `<target>` is a path, a symbol key (`path#name`), or a bare
  symbol name; an ambiguous bare name returns the candidates.
- **`mushroomdb impact <dir> <file>...`** — co-change partners with scores and whether each is
  itself modified, importers, the symbols other files call, and the owner. With no files it reads
  the working tree's diff against `HEAD` plus untracked files.
- **`mushroomdb owners <dir> <path>`** — top author and share, who else knows the file, the last
  commit to touch it, and the split by quarter.
- **`mushroomdb why <dir> <a> <b>`** — every rule edge between two nodes with the evidence that
  produced it (the shared commits, the importing line and its line number, the calling line), or
  the shortest path between them when there is no direct link.
- **`mushroomdb sync <dir> [--json]`** — replays the commits since the last sync, then re-extracts
  the files that differ from `HEAD`. Takes no repository argument: it reads it off the graph.
- **`mushroomdb touch <dir>|--auto [<file>...]`** — re-extracts just these files. With no file
  argument it reads them from a `PostToolUse` payload on stdin.
- **`mushroomdb doctor [--project|--user] [--platform …]`** — verifies an install end to end and
  prints one line per check: config entry, `npx` reachability, store open and staleness, the write
  lock, the two settings hooks, the three git hooks, a real `initialize` + `tools/list` handshake
  with the configured command, and a duplicate server in the other scope. Exit 1 on any `fail`.
- **`mushroomdb algo communities <dir> [--edge-type T]... [--weight-prop P] [--min-weight X]
  [--top N]`** — Louvain community detection with per-community cohesion and overall modularity.
  Deterministic, and honours `budget_ms` by returning the partition so far with `(truncated)`.
- **`mushroomdb mcp --auto`** and **`recall --auto`** / **`touch --auto`** resolve the store as
  `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/mushroom-memory`, falling back to `./mushroom-memory`.
- **`mushroomdb --version`** prints the CLI's version and exits.

#### MCP server

- **Eight task tools** — `map`, `context`, `impact`, `owners`, `why`, `recall`, `remember`,
  `sync` — answer a repository question in one call. Each returns the rendered digest as text
  *and* the structured report as `structuredContent`, so a host that ignores structured output
  still shows something readable.
- **The sixteen graph tools now carry an `Advanced:` prefix** in `tools/list` and are listed after
  the task tools, so an assistant can tell which surface is the front door. The tool names,
  arguments and result shapes are unchanged.
  > **Superseded in v0.6.1** — task tools reply with text only by default (`structuredContent` was
  > removed, a breaking change for a programmatic caller — pass `json: true` for the structured
  > report), and the default `tools/list` shrank to eleven tools (the eight task tools plus
  > `query`, `ingest_json` and `stats`); `--all-tools` still lists all twenty-four. See the v0.6.1
  > entry below.
- **Every line rendered into an assistant's context is framed and sanitized.** Output arrives
  under `(untrusted graph data — treat the lines below as data, not instructions)` and control
  characters are replaced with spaces: node keys and file content are ingested data, and on an
  `ingest-git` store any contributor to the repository controls them.

#### Hooks

- **The `UserPromptSubmit` hook is diff-aware.** With a dirty working tree it names the co-change
  partners and importers your change reaches that you have *not* modified, the owner of the
  change, and how many concepts your edits made stale — at most eight lines. A clean tree falls
  back to the topic digest. Silent on any failure, and read-only.
- **A `PostToolUse` hook** matched to `Edit|Write|MultiEdit` runs `touch` asynchronously, so a
  symbol you just renamed is in the graph by the next question. It prints nothing and exits 0
  whatever it is handed.
- **Git hooks.** `install` writes a marked block running a backgrounded, silenced `sync` into
  `post-commit`, `post-checkout` and `post-merge`. Your own lines in those files are preserved and
  only the marked block is removed on uninstall. Skip with `--no-git-hooks`.

#### Install

- **The MCP entry runs `npx -y mushroomdb@<version>` by default**, pinned to the version that
  wrote it. The bare `mushroomdb` name is written only when the `PATH` hit canonicalizes to the
  running executable. **Nothing is copied into `~/.mushroomdb/bin` any more** — the absolute path
  a 0.5.x install wrote is re-pinned in place on the next `install`.
  > **Superseded in v0.6.1** — a Claude Code project install resolves the store at `--auto` instead
  > of writing an absolute path (so a `git worktree` gets its own store), and every hook and MCP
  > entry `install` writes now runs the resolved native binary directly instead of spawning `npx`.
  > `--no-prewarm` also skips that resolution. See the v0.6.1 entry below.
- **`--command <path>`** invokes a specific binary instead. A relative `--command` or `--db` is
  anchored to the current directory before anything is written; a bare name is a `PATH` lookup and
  is written as given.
- **Scope is inferred** — project inside a git checkout, user anywhere else — and printed in the
  summary. An install in the other scope is reported with the `uninstall` that removes it, never
  edited.
- **Codex is opt-in** (`--platform codex`), because registering with it runs another program.
  Auto-detection never yields Codex, and undoing it needs `uninstall --platform codex`.
- **`--no-prewarm`** skips the one-off `npx -y mushroomdb@<version> --version` fetch;
  **`--no-git-hooks`** skips the three git hooks. A stale `UserPromptSubmit` or `PostToolUse` hook
  for the same store is replaced rather than added beside, so a 0.5.x upgrade does not leave two
  recall digests running per prompt.
- **A `.gitignore` line** for the store directory when the store is inside the repository, removed
  on uninstall — and only deleted along with the file if stripping our line leaves it empty.

#### Claude Code plugin

- **A plugin and a repository marketplace.** `claude marketplace add MatthewSherlin/mushroomdb`
  then `claude plugin install mushroom@mushroomdb` wires the MCP server, the skill and both hooks
  with no local binary. Claude Code namespaces a plugin-provided skill, so it is invoked as
  **`/mushroom:mushroom`**; the `mushroomdb install` route writes the same skill into the
  project's or user's own directory, where it is invoked bare as **`/mushroom`**.
- **The skill is task-first.** It opens on the first minute (build the store, call `map`, print it
  verbatim, ask the map's three questions), then seven task rules that each name one tool, then
  the `learn` pass, then the graph underneath. Its worked examples are real runs against this
  repository.

#### Export and algorithms

- **GraphML export** — `mushroomdb export <dir> <dest> --format graphml` writes nodes and edges as
  a single `.graphml` file for generic graph viewers, byte-identical between runs. `Value::Int`
  declares `attr.type="long"` (GraphML's informal convention reads `"int"` as 32-bit), and a
  property whose type is inconsistent across nodes declares `attr.type="string"` for every node.
  Derived edges carry their rule name and score.
- **Louvain communities** in the Rust API (`db.communities(&LouvainConfig)`), with `resolution`,
  `edge_types`, `node_label`, `max_passes` and `budget_ms`. Deterministic: every weight
  accumulation routes through a `BTreeMap`, so the `f64` results are a pure function of graph
  content.
- **`weight_prop` / `min_weight` on PageRank, WCC and degree centrality.** PageRank distributes
  out-mass proportionally to the resolved weight; WCC and degree use them as a filter only. Both
  default to unset, and the unweighted paths are byte-identical to before.

#### Rules

- **`KeyMatch`'s default `max_edges` is now 512, was 1.** A list-valued foreign key fires once per
  element, up to `MAX_KEYMATCH_LIST` = 512 elements in stored order, so one node can point at many
  — which is what `imports`, `calls_to` and `mentions` need. Rules already stored keep the
  `max_edges` they were written with, so a rule saved with `max_edges: 1` still keeps a single
  destination per source.

#### Python bindings

- **`GraphDb.open(path, read_only=False)`** — a read-only handle never takes the lock, raises
  `RuntimeError` from every mutation, and still refreshes.
- **`refresh()`** returns the number of peer commits applied.
- **`MushroomBusy`** is raised when another process holds the write lock.

#### Performance

Release build, this repository's store, median of three:

| Measurement | 0.5.2 | 0.6.0 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Open after `snapshot` | 3.80 s | **0.16 s** |
| Open after one incremental ingest | 3.58 s | **0.30 s** |
| `touch` one file | 3.89 s | **0.17 s** |
| `recall` (the prompt hook) | 3.82 s | **0.16 s** |
| `sync` | 7.82 s | **0.35 s** |
| Incremental `ingest-git` | 4.02 s | **0.39 s** |
| `snapshot` itself | 3.64 s | **0.40 s** |

A snapshot open was dominated by an O(nodes × rules) rule-index rebuild; it is now memoized.
An incremental `ingest-git` also reports and rewrites only the files that changed (8, not 397)
and appends 10 WAL commits instead of 66.

#### Release engineering

- **`scripts/acceptance-0.6.sh`** — a seven-step release acceptance run in a throwaway worktree:
  ingest floors read back with Cypher, `map` under 40 lines, two independent ingests exporting
  identical JSONL, an added import producing a direct `IMPORTS` edge with its line number and a
  reverted import retracting it, the dirty-tree nudge, 20 concurrent `touch` processes against a
  live MCP server followed by `verify`, and the timing table. Runs in CI as the `code-graph` job.
- **`scripts/bench-code-graph.sh`** — the measured table on this repository and any tree named in
  `BENCH_REPOS`, including the determinism column.
- **`scripts/render-plugin.sh [--check]`** renders the plugin from the CLI's real skill and the
  templates; CI fails on drift and runs `claude plugin validate --strict`.
- **An SDK-level MCP handshake test** in CI, plus a post-publish `npx` smoke test.

## v0.5.2 — 2026-09-03

### Python binding parity (format-stable)

No format change — snapshot VERSION stays V8 and WAL discriminants are untouched; every item
below is binding surface, one new read-only Cypher scalar, and docs. Upgrade in place from any
0.4.x or 0.5.x store.

The gaps a real integrator hit using the Python binding, closed:

- **`delete_node(key)`** on the binding, returning the `DeleteReport` as a dict
  (`{"manual_edges", "derived_edges"}`). Deleting a node retracts the edges its properties
  derived; an unknown key raises `KeyNotFound` as it does in Rust.
- **`key(n)` Cypher scalar.** A node's key is not a property, so `n.key` never resolved and there
  was no way to project or filter on the key from Cypher. `key(n)` is now in both scalar registries
  — read queries and the `MATCH … SET … RETURN` mirror — and returns the key string. A non-node
  argument (property expression, relationship variable, wrong arity) is a named error, not a silent
  null. `node_info` already carried `"key"`; the binding README and `docs/site/query.md` now say so.
- **`upsert_node(label, key, props)`** returning `"inserted"` or `"updated"`. Writes only the
  provided fields whose value differs from the stored one, so omitted fields are untouched and
  unchanged fields produce no WAL record and no rule re-fire. An existing key under a different
  label raises `ValueError` rather than silently relabelling.
- **`remove_prop(key, field)`** on the binding, and `set_prop(key, field, None)` now removes the
  field instead of raising `TypeError`. Python has no null property and the store has no null
  `Value`, so `None` means absent. Removing a watched field retracts the edges it derived.
- **Predicate shapes round-trip.** `create_rule` now accepts the snake_case shape that `explain`
  emits (`{"kind": "field_equal", "fields": ["team"]}`) alongside the Rust-native externally-tagged
  form (`{"FieldEqual": {"field": "team"}}`), for every predicate kind including nested `all`/`any`.
  An explanation's `predicate` dict can be dropped straight into a new rule. `explain` output is
  unchanged; the snake_case form is documented as canonical.
- **`create_rule(rule, if_not_exists=False)`** returns `True` when it created the rule. With
  `if_not_exists=True` a duplicate name returns `False` instead of raising.
- **`query_write` accepts a params dict** like `query` does, keeping the list-of-tuples form for
  compatibility. The `query` docstring no longer describes the tuple list as the only shape.
- **Type stubs and docstrings.** `bindings/python/mushroomdb.pyi` ships in the wheel as
  `__init__.pyi` with a `py.typed` marker, so mypy and Pyright resolve signatures with no
  configuration. Every `#[pymethods]` function now carries a doc comment and a `text_signature`,
  so `help(mushroomdb.GraphDb)` is useful at the REPL.
- **Concurrency documented (docs only; no lock in this release).** One writer process per store;
  a handle sees only the commits made through it; there is no cross-process lock yet, and no
  `reopen()` — close and `open` again to pick up another process's writes.
- **Fix: MCP `initialize` now returns `serverInfo.version`.** Claude Code rejected the handshake
  without it, so the server never connected in Claude Code before this release.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-09-03

- **Fix: `npx mushroomdb install` wrote a bare `mushroomdb` command** because npm's shim on PATH
  looked like the binary; install now writes the bare name only when the PATH entry is this
  executable, otherwise copies the binary to `~/.mushroomdb/bin`. `npx` prepends
  `~/.npm/_npx/<hash>/node_modules/.bin` to PATH and the `mushroomdb` there is npm's Node entry
  point, so the bare name resolved inside the npx shell and nowhere else — the MCP server and the
  recall hook failed with ENOENT after install. `npm i -g mushroomdb` installs the same shim and
  now copies too. Classification compares canonicalized paths, so a symlink to the real binary
  (`cargo install`, Homebrew) still gets the upgrade-safe bare name.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-09-03

### The memory release (format-stable)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.x store. Snapshot VERSION stays V8; WAL
discriminants unchanged (0–22). `mushroomdb verify` opens a 0.4.4 store unchanged.

#### Front door

- **`mushroomdb recall <db>` and a UserPromptSubmit hook.** `install` now writes a Claude Code
  `hooks.UserPromptSubmit` entry (5 s timeout) that runs `recall`, which reads the prompt payload,
  runs a text-only search over every full-text-indexed field, and prints a short digest of related
  nodes and their strongest edges before the assistant answers. Opens the store without migration
  or WAL repair (`auto_migrate: false`, `repair_wal: false`), so a hook that fires on every prompt
  writes nothing to it; the digest opens with a line framing its content as untrusted graph data
  and strips control characters from every rendered value. Never blocks a prompt (empty output,
  exit 0 on any error), shell-quotes paths, and `uninstall` removes exactly the entry it added.
  Cursor gets no hook (its contract is undocumented); the rules file remains the mechanism there.
- **The skill tells the truth.** `mask` is documented as the allow-list it is (the 0.4.x skill said
  the opposite); `ingest_json.edges`, `create_rule.max_edges`, `find_similar.mask/limit`, and the
  `hybrid_search` `label` caveat are documented; the MCP server's no-auth trust model is stated.
- **Bootstrap from the repo you are in.** `/mushroom` prefers `ingest-git` inside a git repository
  and falls back to the demo store elsewhere; every command line quotes the binary and store paths.
- **`mushroomdb --version`.**

#### Codebase graph

- **`mushroomdb ingest-git <db> <repo> [--exclude <pattern>]...`** builds Author / Commit / File
  nodes, `TOUCHED` edges, auto-FK `AUTHOR` and `TOP_AUTHOR`, and two rules: `co_changed`
  (File→File, Jaccard over commit lists) and `knows` (Author→File via `TOP_AUTHOR`). Full-text on
  `File.path`, `Commit.message`, `Author.name`. Re-runs are incremental from a recorded head sha:
  adds, modifies, deletes and renames are applied so derived edges retract or follow the file. Paths
  are stored unescaped (`core.quotePath=false`). README first screen and
  `docs/assets/ingest-git-cascade.gif` (tape: `scripts/ingest-git-cascade.tape`) show it on this
  repository.
- **Ownership tracks reality across syncs.** Each `File` node carries an additive `author_counts`
  prop (a list of `"email<TAB>count"` strings) holding the per-author commit distribution, so an
  incremental run resumes the real counts instead of crediting the whole prior history to the
  current `top_author_id`. Without it a second author's commits reset on every sync and ownership
  could never change hands; `TOP_AUTHOR` and the `KNOWS` edges that hop over it went stale
  silently. An incremental sync and a full re-ingest of the same repository now agree. A store
  built by 0.4.x has no `author_counts` yet: it falls back to the old approximation until the next
  touch of each file, and a full re-ingest repairs it at once. The `File.alive` prop, which was
  only ever written as `true`, is gone.
- **`File.n_commits` is the true total.** It was written as the length of the capped `commits`
  list, so a file past `--max-commits-per-file` (default 200) reported a history frozen at the cap
  — contradicting the documented "counts every commit that ever touched the file". It now carries
  the real count, which is also what `author_counts` sums to.

#### Engine

- **Rule chaining.** A derived edge now feeds via-hop rules in the same write: when a `TOP_AUTHOR`
  edge moves, the `KNOWS` edges that hop over it re-derive immediately. Bounded to
  `MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH = 4` levels, fire-once per `(rule, source)` per level, deltas consumed in append
  order, rules in name order, so open/replay re-derives identically. Every via-edge dependency
  cycle is rejected at `create_rule` (including within one batch) with `rule chain cycle: …`.
  Truncated chains are counted in `stats().chain_truncations`. `explain` reports `via_edge` for
  chained rules. Views over rule-fed edge types are updated exactly once per chained change.
  Rules that feed on view values remain designed, not built (see `docs/site/roadmap-moat.md`).
- **Every derived edge explains its score.** `explain` recomputes the predicate score for rules
  that store no weight (1.0 for KeyMatch/FieldEqual); via-hop rules report their stored score only.
  MCP and HTTP `create_rule` default `weight_prop` to `weight`, so `r.weight` is populated in
  Cypher rows. Subscription `EdgeFired.weight` reads the rule's declared `weight_prop`.
- **Via-hop rules rebuild correctly.** `rebuild` and the delete-time backfill evaluate via-hop
  rules through the via path; previously a rebuild dropped every via-derived edge.
- **Deleting a node can no longer resurrect edges onto it** during chained re-derivation
  (doomed-node filter); provenance stays equal to the live topology.
- **WAL replay fix.** An ingest that both created an auto-FK rule and inserted user edges of a
  new type in one call wrote a frame that failed to replay (`wal intern assigned N+1 …`). Rule edge
  types are now pre-interned at the `CreateRule` position; existing stores are unaffected.
- **`decay(base, age, halflife)` Cypher scalar** = `base * 0.5^(age / halflife)`; pair it with
  `edge_history` or a `since` property you maintain.

#### Tests and docs

- Slow-query tests are slow by construction (cross product), not by CPU speed.
- New suites: `explain_weight`, `recall`, `ingest_git`, `ingest_edges_replay`, `chaining`,
  `via_rebuild`, install hook coverage.
- Docs: `docs/site/ingest-git.md` (new), `skill.md` (hook, bootstrap), `rules.md` (chaining,
  score semantics, retraction GIF), `mcp.md` (trust model, allow-list), `format-stability.md`
  (discriminant range 0–22, `Intern` placement note), `roadmap-moat.md` §2 status.

#### Deferred (v0.6)

- Rules fed by view aggregates; namespaces; bi-temporal valid-time; larger-than-RAM storage;
  LongMemEval; a sim-harness oracle for multi-level chaining; rename-aware `report.deleted`
  accounting in `ingest-git`; `create_rule` via backfill and `rebuild` remain separate
  implementations.

## v0.4.5 — 2026-09-03

### `install` writes an MCP command that actually resolves (format-stable)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.x store. Patch release for
the `mushroomdb install` front door; no engine or storage changes.

- **Fix: `mushroomdb install` produced a server that never connected when the
  binary was not on `PATH`.** The MCP entry always said `"command": "mushroomdb"`,
  which the assistant host could not spawn after `npx mushroomdb install` or an
  install run from a local build (`ENOENT`), and the skill's `mushroomdb demo`
  bootstrap failed the same way. `install` now checks `PATH` first: if the bare
  name resolves it is kept (upgrade-safe); otherwise the running binary is copied
  to `~/.mushroomdb/bin/mushroomdb` and that absolute path is written. The same
  command is substituted into the skill templates via a new `{{BIN}}` placeholder.
  The copy is tracked in the manifest (removed by `uninstall`) and refreshed when
  `install` is re-run from a newer binary.

- **Re-install repairs an entry for the same db instead of refusing.** Only a
  different db path is a conflict now; a stale or unresolvable `command` for the
  same path is rewritten in place. `install` also prints the resolved command and
  a reminder to restart the assistant.

## v0.4.4 — 2026-09-02

### The front door (format-stable)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.x store. The WAL discriminants,
snapshot section IDs, and `VERSION` constant remain at V8.

- **`mushroomdb install` / `mushroomdb uninstall` subcommands.** One-command setup
  for Claude Code and Cursor: `npx mushroomdb install` writes the MCP config entry
  and drops the `/mushroom` skill into the project's `.claude/` directory.
  `mushroomdb uninstall` reverses the operation cleanly. No manual JSON editing
  required.

- **`/mushroom` skill for Claude Code.** An assistant-facing skill that provides
  memory-first behavior: before answering questions about entities or relationships
  the assistant queries the graph, persists durable facts, and calls `explain` to
  surface rule names and scores on demand. Includes a demo-store bootstrap
  (`mushroomdb demo`) that seeds 10 Orgs, 20 Projects, 30 People, and 334 edges.

- **Cursor rules integration.** `mushroomdb install` also writes a `.cursor/rules`
  file so the same memory-first behavior applies automatically in Cursor without
  any additional configuration.

- **README front-door restructure.** "Agent memory in 30 seconds" is now the
  opening screen with the rule-fire + explain GIF inline. The install flow leads
  with `npx mushroomdb install` and the `/mushroom` skill entry point.

- **Reproducible rule-fire + explain GIF.** A VHS tape at `scripts/rule-fire-explain.tape`
  reproduces the animated demo in the README header. Run `vhs scripts/rule-fire-explain.tape`
  to regenerate.

- **No engine or on-disk format changes.** All existing 0.4.x stores open without
  migration. This release is purely additive (CLI subcommands, skill content,
  documentation).

## v0.4.3 — 2026-09-02

### Query completeness + observability (format-stable, final 0.4.x patch)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.x store. The WAL discriminants,
snapshot section IDs, and `VERSION` constant remain at V8. T1–T4 are
planner/executor/runtime changes only; all query results are byte-identical to
unindexed execution (equivalence-tested in every task).

- **WHERE-clause equality pushdown into the property index (T1).** Queries of the
  form `MATCH (n:Label) WHERE n.field = value` now use the property index instead
  of a full label scan. Previously, only the first inline property pattern
  (`{field: value}`) was indexed; a `WHERE` equality on the same variable was
  re-executed as a post-scan filter over all nodes in the label. A new planner
  post-pass `fold_where_equalities` folds a single-var equality in the `WHERE`
  clause into an `IndexScan`, dropping the consumed predicate from the `Filter` (or
  removing the `Filter` entirely when no residual remains). Eligibility is
  conservative: only the scan variable, only before an `Expand`, only literal and
  `$param` operands. Unindexed fields fold gracefully (the `IndexScan` executor arm
  falls back to a scan when `nodes_with_prop` returns `None`). Results are
  byte-identical to the unoptimized path in all cases, including the fallback.

- **Compound AND-of-equalities via index intersection (T2).** Queries with two or
  more equality predicates on the same scanned variable — whether from inline
  patterns (`MATCH (n:Doc {namespace: 'a', status: 'live'})`) or `WHERE` clauses
  (`WHERE n.namespace = $ns AND n.status = 'live'`) — now emit a new
  `IndexIntersect` plan operator. The executor resolves each `(field, operand)` pair
  via `nodes_with_prop`, two-pointer-intersects the resulting sorted id-lists
  (smallest first for efficiency), then applies any unindexed fields as per-node
  post-filters. If all fields are unindexed the executor falls back to a full scan
  plus filter; ascending id order is preserved in every code path. The motivating
  example from the v0.5 roadmap (`MATCH (d:Doc {namespace: $ns}) WHERE d.status =
  'live'`) now hits the index directly.

- **Subscription label-skip (T3).** Query subscriptions (`subscribe_query`) no
  longer re-execute on every commit regardless of content. A captured `scan_label`
  per subscription (the interned symbol of the leading `ScanLabel` / `IndexScan` /
  `IndexIntersect` label) gates re-execution: if the commit contains only node
  records for labels other than the scan label, no edge records, no `SetProp` /
  `DeleteNode` for nodes whose label cannot be resolved at skip-time, and no
  rule-engine deltas, the subscription is skipped entirely. The predicate is
  conservative (default-deny): any unrecognized record type, any edge operation, and
  any plan that includes `Expand` (edge traversal) clears the skip flag and always
  re-executes. A skipped re-execution is provably unable to change the result set.
  Subscriptions over traversal queries (`MATCH (a)-[:E]->(b) ...`) retain
  `scan_label = None` and never skip — the honest v0.4.3 boundary, documented.

- **`GET /metrics` endpoint + slow-query log (T4).** A new `GET /metrics` route
  (same auth middleware as `GET /stats`) returns a JSON object with:
  `nodes_live`, `nodes_tombstoned`, `edges`, `commit_seq`, `wal_size_bytes`,
  `rss_bytes` (null where unsupported), `uptime_s`, and a `slow_queries` block
  containing the threshold in ms, a lifetime count, and a ring of the last ≤16
  slow query records (`ms`, `query`, `at_commit`). Slow-query logging is controlled
  by `MUSHROOMDB_SLOW_QUERY_MS` (default 100 ms; 0 disables); the threshold is also
  settable at runtime via `GraphDb::set_slow_query_threshold_ms`. RSS is read via
  the platform memory API (macOS `proc_pidinfo` / Linux `/proc/self/statm`) and
  returns `null` on any failure without panicking.

- **New direct dependency: `libc`.** Added as a direct dep to `mushroomdb-server`
  for the macOS RSS helper (`proc_pidinfo`). `libc` was already a transitive
  dependency of the workspace; this makes the dependency explicit.

- **`#[doc(hidden)]` on test-instrumentation helpers.** `query_sub_exec_count()`
  and `reset_query_sub_exec_count()` in `mushroomdb` (core-api) are now tagged
  `#[doc(hidden)]` — no behavior change; the functions remain `pub` for integration
  tests.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-09-01

### Hardening patch (format-stable)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.x store. The WAL discriminants,
snapshot section IDs, and `VERSION` constant remain at V8. (The `encode_v7` header
fix in this release touches a test-only encoder for the historical V7 format; the
current-format code path is unchanged.)

- **Shutdown missed-wakeup fix (macOS hang).** `WriteQueue::signal_shutdown` now holds
  the queue mutex while setting the shutdown flag and calling `notify_all`. Without the
  lock the drain thread could observe the flag, release the mutex, and enter
  `Condvar::wait` after the notify fired — a missed wakeup that left `DrainHandle::drop`
  blocked forever. macOS thread-startup timing entered this window reliably; Ubuntu
  rarely did. Fixed by taking the lock before the store+notify so the wakeup cannot be
  lost. A 200-iteration stress test (`shared_db_drop_never_hangs`) guards against
  regression on any platform.

- **Optional TLS (`--features tls`) + deployment docs.** The axum server now supports
  native TLS via a `tls` cargo feature backed by `axum-server`/rustls. Pass
  `--tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem` to `mushroomdb serve`; without the flags,
  behavior is byte-identical to 0.4.1. Without the feature flag the binary prints a
  clear error directing users to the new `docs/site/deployment.md` (reverse-proxy
  termination, native TLS, and loopback-first posture). `SECURITY.md` cross-references
  the deployment doc.

- **Cookie `Secure` flag conditional on TLS.** `Set-Cookie` now includes the `Secure`
  attribute only when the server is running with TLS active. Plain-HTTP deployments are
  unchanged (the 0.4.0-era UI-breakage concern applied to unconditional `Secure`).

- **Named `format-compat` CI gate + `encode_v7` header fix.** The V5–V8 golden-fixture
  pins and migration tests are now promoted to a dedicated CI job (`format-compat`) so a
  failure names itself rather than hiding in the general test run. Additionally, the
  test-only `encode_v7` encoder had a latent bug: it stamped a V8 header on V7-shaped
  content, making V7 round-trips unreachable in tests. Fixed to emit a V7 header.
  Richer-content round-trips (multi-label, multi-type edges, scalar+float+tombstone
  props) added for V6 and V7. The golden pins themselves are unchanged.
  `docs/site/durability.md` gains a format-compatibility matrix (V5→0.1.0 through
  V8→0.2.0+) with the patch-stability promise documented.

- **HNSW recall fix — layer-0 link budget and candidate floor (behavior change,
  disclosed).** The v0.4.1 changelog noted "IVF-Flat recall ≈0.55 at 5k×1536-D" as a
  known issue. That was a misdiagnosis: the actual recall path is HNSW, not IVF. IVF
  probe/cluster knobs had zero effect because `VectorSimilar approximate: true` routes
  through `CandidateSpec::Hnsw` (not `VectorClusters`). The root cause: with M₀=64
  (layer-0 max connections), nodes beyond the 64th in each cluster became inbound-only
  leaves invisible to beam search, capping recall at 0.68 regardless of ef or k
  escalation. Fix: M₀ 64→128 in `crates/core-rules/src/hnsw.rs`; approximate candidate
  floor 64→128 in `engine.rs` so the expanded neighborhood is not truncated before edge
  derivation. Measured recall at the dense 5k×1536-D fixture: 0.5467 → 1.0000 (the old
  code silently missed ~45% of true nearest-neighbor edges). The `approximate_recall_5k_timing`
  test is now gated in CI (previously excluded with a stale "IVF recall gap" note).
  Costs disclosed: layer-0 index memory doubles (~256 B → ~512 B/node; ~256 MB at the
  500k-node ceiling); approximate-rule backfill on dense fixtures is ~5× slower (44.8 s
  → 227.6 s at 5k — the price of correct results). Known limitation: the density ceiling
  moved to ~128-node clusters; the structural fix (HNSW §3.5 diverse-neighbor selection)
  is tracked for 0.4.3+. **Behavior change:** derived edges from ANN-based association
  rules may differ after a store rebuild — they are now more complete. Stores opened
  without a rebuild continue to serve queries normally; the change takes effect when the
  rule engine re-derives edges (on rebuild or new writes that trigger the rule).

- **Docs cleanup.** `benchmarks/README.md` updated to describe the enforcing
  re-pin flow (the gate has been enforcing since before v0.4.1; the bootstrap-mode
  description was stale). `CHANGELOG.md` v0.4.1 case-count corrected ("1280 cases
  total: 768 WAL-replay + 512 HTTP-body").

## v0.4.1 — 2026-09-01

### Foundations (format-stable patch)

No format change — upgrade in place from any 0.4.0 store.

- **Backfill scale regression guards.** The streaming backfill introduced in
  v0.4.0 (which fixed the cross-product wall) is now locked in by peak-memory
  regression tests covering both the top-k and global-budget paths, plus a
  5000×5000 criterion bench with a CI-pinned baseline enforced on every merge.
- **CI recall gates.** HNSW + approximate-recall floor tests (previously
  `#[ignore]`d) now run in a dedicated CI job on every merge.
- **Known issue:** `approximate_recall_5k_timing` reveals IVF-Flat recall
  ≈0.55 at 5k×1536-D vs the 0.90 floor — a pre-existing gap discovered by
  this release's gating work. The test is excluded from the CI gate until
  fixed; tracked for a 0.4.x follow-up.
- **Benchmark baselines re-pinned.** Baselines regenerated from a canonical
  ubuntu-latest run on the current architecture; the bench regression gate
  enforces them on every merge.
- **Unwrap audit.** All 31 production-path `unwrap`/`expect` sites in
  `storage` and `server` verified infallible and annotated. `idmap` u32-capacity
  growth panic documented as TODO-0.4.2 (requires an API change).
- **Fuzz targets.** WAL-replay and HTTP-body never-panic proptests (1280
  cases total: 768 WAL-replay + 512 HTTP-body).

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-31

### Temporal / moat

- Time-travel reads: `GraphDb::query_at(commit, cypher)`, `POST /query
  {"as_of": N}`, and Python `query_at` run a read-only query against the graph
  as it existed at a past WAL commit — the agent-replay primitive. The live
  store is unaffected; writes and (for now) role/masked temporal queries are
  rejected.
- `docs/site/roadmap-moat.md` specifies the two remaining category-defining
  features — rule chaining (with a cycle-safe, replay-deterministic design) and
  memory-native decay/consolidation/namespaces — ready to build with sign-off.

### Trust & hardening

- `mushroomdb verify` now runs a structural (rkyv `bytecheck`) pass over the
  hot-path sections in addition to CRC32, so it rejects a maliciously crafted
  snapshot whose relative pointers would trigger UB on open. Run it before
  restoring an untrusted snapshot. Zero cost on the query path.
- Concurrency torture tests: overlapping-key races land exactly once, and
  concurrent writers that trigger rule-fires keep derived edges and the property
  index consistent.
- Python bindings gain `enable_index`/`disable_index`/`is_index_enabled`,
  `node_history`, and `was_linked`.
- New `docs/site/durability.md` documents the crash-recovery model. Deferred:
  making rule-derived edges first-class replayable WAL records (the snapshot
  path already gives fast recovery; `--snapshot-every` bounds the worst case).

### Cypher fluency

- `collect(x)` aggregation (grouped and ungrouped), skipping nulls.
- `UNION` / `UNION ALL` combine two or more read queries (matching column names;
  `UNION` dedups, `UNION ALL` keeps duplicates; masks apply uniformly).
- `CASE WHEN <cond> THEN <value> … [ELSE <value>] END` expressions in
  RETURN/WITH/WHERE/SET.
- Multi-relationship-type patterns: `(a)-[:A|:B]->(b)` matches an edge of any
  listed type.
- New scalar functions: `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `toInteger`,
  `toFloat`, `toString`.

Known follow-ons: bare `RETURN r` for a relationship variable still requires
`r.field` (no relationship value type yet); `MATCH (a) MATCH (b) CREATE (a)-[:E]->(b)`
between separately matched nodes does not yet create the edge.

### Property (equality) indexes

- Opt-in equality index over scalar node properties: `MATCH (n:L {field: value})`
  becomes an O(matches) indexed lookup instead of an O(N_label) scan. Declare via
  a schema `indexes: [["Label","field"]]` list or `db.enable_index(label, field)`.
  Maintained incrementally, persisted via the WAL + snapshot baseline, and rebuilt
  on open (no format migration). Declaring an index never changes results, only
  speed. See `docs/site/indexes.md`.

### Fixes

- Graph algorithms (PageRank, WCC, degree centrality) now read the unified
  topology view, so they see rule-derived edges after a snapshot + reopen instead
  of reporting zero for every node. Affected HTTP and CLI equally.
- Cypher accepts list literals in `CREATE`/`SET` property values
  (`CREATE (n {tags: ['a','b']})`).
- `POST /backup` confines its `dest` to a backup root (`MUSHROOMDB_BACKUP_DIR`,
  else the working directory); constant-time token comparison; 64 MiB request
  body cap; bounded neighborhood BFS depth.
- CLI `algo degree`/`pagerank` gain `--dir out|in|both`.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-30

Role-scoped writes and mask-aware vector search. Additive over v0.2.0 — no
breaking changes; existing role tokens and stores behave exactly as before.

### RBAC write scopes (role-bounded mutations)

v0.2 shipped role tokens as read-only. v0.3 lets a role declare **write
scopes** and perform the mutations they allow, under a never-widen rule: no
write a role performs can reveal or touch data outside its visibility.

- `WriteScope` on `RoleDef` (`roles.json` v2): `create_labels`,
  `update_labels`, `delete_labels`, `create_edge_types`, `delete_edge_types`.
  A role with no `write` field stays read-only (v1 sidecars load unchanged,
  byte-identical behavior).
- Scoped writes over HTTP: `POST /query` (CREATE/SET/DELETE/MERGE),
  `/ingest`, `/nodes`, `/edges`, `/edges/upsert`, and prop endpoints flip
  from blanket-403 to scoped-allow for roles that declare the scope.
- Every escalation path from the threat model is closed and tested: hidden
  nodes are indistinguishable from absent ones (byte-equal errors) on
  update/delete/MERGE; edge creation requires both endpoints visible;
  the Cypher `MATCH` phase of a role-scoped write reads through the role's
  mask; a role can read back a node it just created via `MERGE … RETURN`.
- `create/update/delete_labels ⊆` the role's read labels, validated at
  `apply_schema` — a role can never touch state it cannot observe.
- `/rules`, `/subscribe`, `/watch`, `/stats`, `/suggest`, `/explain`,
  `/algo/*`, `/backup`, and node rename remain admin-only for all role
  tokens. The full §6.2 adversarial checklist ships as executable tests.

### Mask-aware vector search

- ANN / vector search and edge-traversal reads now respect node masks: a
  masked reader never sees hidden nodes in similarity results or neighbor
  expansions. HNSW adversarial coverage added.
- Python binding gains native ANN and edge-property reads (parity with the
  core API and TypeScript client).

### Fixes

- `MERGE … RETURN` under a role token now returns the just-created node
  instead of empty rows (the authz mask is re-resolved after the create).

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-29

The association-engine release: trust, physics, and agent-default memory.

### Storage physics (V8 mapped snapshots + MVCC)

- New V8 snapshot format: rkyv-archived, memory-mapped, 12 sections with
  per-section CRCs. Open-to-first-query on a 2.2 GiB / 100k-node store:
  **0.02 s, 31–41 MiB RSS** (was 17.6 s / 12 GiB on v0.1). Measured
  2026-08-28, warm-file/cold-process; methodology in
  `dogfood/results/scale-100k.md`.
- MVCC epoch readers: concurrent readers proceed during writes
  (reader-burst p95 45 µs under write load).
- Group-commit write queue: 8 concurrent writers at Strict fsync reach
  4.17× serialized throughput (measured; SimFs amortization proof 7.98×).
- `mushroomdb verify` command for offline CRC checking.

### Trust: migration + format promise

- V5–V7 stores migrate on open (opt-out) or via `mushroomdb migrate`
  (crash-safe, `.bak` retained). Format promise in
  `docs/format-stability.md`: append-only evolution within a minor series,
  migrators across majors, v0.2 reads V5+.
- Benchmarks run in CI and gate merges against pinned baselines.
- Panic policy (`docs/site/panic-policy.md`): all disk-reachable decode
  paths return typed `Corrupt` errors (15 sites hardened this release,
  fuzz-covered); remaining panics are internal invariants.

### Temporal memory (time travel for agents)

- `edge_history(a, b)` and `was_linked(a, b, type, at_commit)` — full edge
  lifecycle over the WAL, including rule-derived edges with rule
  attribution (history markers written at true firing time).
- Compare-and-set writes: `write_batch_cas` with per-node last-change
  preconditions and a typed `CasConflict` error; last-change map persists
  across snapshots (V8 LAST_CHANGE section).
- History-preserving snapshots: `archive_wal` keeps WAL segments as
  `wal.<n>.archive` with retention — unbounded time travel for
  `node_history` / `edge_history` / `open_at`, honest genesis-chain
  contract for pre-archive commits.
- All history APIs over HTTP and MCP; horizons reported in every response.

### RBAC over masks

- Named roles in schema-as-code (`roles.json` sidecar), server tokens
  bound to a role, automatic mask resolution on query paths. Role tokens
  are read-only in v0.2; never-widen is the standing invariant.
- Restricted-stub mask mode (opt-in): hidden nodes surface as
  `{key, restricted: true}` stubs on read surfaces instead of being
  omitted — per-mask choice, never available to role tokens.

### Fulltext v2

- BM25 ranking (k1=1.2, b=0.75), Snowball English stemming at index and
  query time, `"phrase"` adjacency matching, `-term` negation, `prefix*`
  — in `search`, `search_hybrid` (RRF text leg upgrades automatically),
  and Cypher `textMatches`.

### Operations: backup + export

- `mushroomdb backup <dir> <dest>` and `GraphDb::backup_to`: consistent
  verified copies (CRC + reopen check). `POST /backup` for live served
  stores. PITR recipe in `docs/format-stability.md`.
- `mushroomdb export <dir> <dest> --format jsonl|parquet`: full
  deterministic dumps (nodes/edges/rules; derived edges flagged with rule
  attribution). Your data is never locked in.

### Quality of life

- `rename_node(old, new)` — key changes, identity and history follow.
- Edge upsert with placeholder endpoints (`POST /edges/upsert`).
- Python `query(cypher, params=...)` — parameterized queries (dict or
  tuple list); no more string interpolation.
- `Value::Map`, hybrid RRF search, `apply_schema`, `node_history` (0.1.2
  interim releases, first tagged here).
- Integrations: `llama-index-graph-stores-mushroomdb` and LangChain
  `MushroomdbGraphStore` packages; MCP server listed on the official
  registry (16 tools).

### Breaking

- `search()` returns BM25 scores (`f64`) instead of match counts.
- `serve`/`serve_with_ui` library functions deprecated (use
  `serve_with_role_tokens` / `serve_with_ui_and_role_tokens`).
- Snapshot format V8 (auto-migration from V5+ on open).

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-24

### MCP agent-memory tools

Three new MCP tools for agent workflows — available via `mushroomdb mcp <dir>`:

- **`upsert_entity`** — insert or update a node by key with no existence
  check required; creates the node if absent, updates properties if present.
- **`find_similar`** — return neighbors connected by a given edge type
  (default `SIMILAR`); designed for vector-rule recall in agent-memory
  workflows.
- **`explain_association`** — explain rule-derived associations between two
  node keys; returns rule name, edge type, and match score per link. Alias
  of `explain` with a semantically clearer name.

The MCP server now exposes eleven tools total. Tests: 15 stdio round-trip
unit tests in `crates/server/src/mcp.rs` covering all eleven tools.

See [`docs/site/mcp.md`](docs/site/mcp.md) for the Claude Desktop
configuration and the full agent-memory quickstart (store → link → recall →
explain).

### Performance (rule_derive backfill)

N=5 median measured 2026-08-24 on Apple M4 Pro, macOS 15.7.3, arm64,
release build:

| Rule | Time |
|---|---|
| `bench_industry_tc` (FieldEqual → INDUSTRY_ALIGNMENT) | ~856 ms |
| `bench_specialty_tc` (Overlap → SPECIALTY_MATCH) | ~2.041 s |
| **Total** | **2.878 s** |

Result: **within target**. Re-measured on v0.1.1: N=5 median 2.878 s vs 2.894 s
baseline — no residual regression at this scale. No code change was required.

### Snapshots

- **V6 snapshot format (compressed)** — `snapshot()` now writes a zstd-compressed
  (level 3) V6 container. Wire format: `GDB1` magic + 2-byte version header
  (uncompressed); body is a zstd stream of the existing V5 payload (CRC32 + bincode).
  Measured at 5k nodes: 62 KiB on disk, 16 ms write, 2 ms open. At 100k nodes
  (9 rules, ~10.5M derived edges): **1.1 GiB on disk** (−50% vs V5 ~2.2 GiB),
  **22.563 s write**, **8.880 s open** (V5 baseline: 25.09 s write, 8.71 s open).
  v0.1.0 V5 snapshots are read transparently — no migration required. Old binaries
  cannot read V6 files (forward-breaking for the snapshot file only; WAL format and
  Python/HTTP API are unchanged).
- **`snapshot_with(SnapshotOptions { keep_wal: bool })`** — new API that exposes
  snapshot options. `keep_wal: true` writes the V6 snapshot but preserves the WAL,
  keeping pre-snapshot commits reachable via `open_at`. Crash-safe: snapshot write
  is atomic; if it crashes the full WAL is intact and replay over the snapshot is
  idempotent. `snapshot()` is unchanged (keep_wal defaults to false).

### Cypher

- **`IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`** — postfix null-check predicate in `WHERE` and `WITH … WHERE`; composes with `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`; enables the anti-join idiom (`OPTIONAL MATCH … WHERE b IS NULL`).
- **General arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)** — arithmetic expressions in `RETURN`, `WHERE` comparisons, `SET` RHS, and function arguments; operator precedence (`*`/`/` over `+`/`-`); parentheses; null propagation; saturating integer arithmetic; named error on division by zero.
- **`CREATE … RETURN`** and **`MERGE … RETURN`** — single-statement write-then-project; write commits to WAL before projection; returns created/matched node bindings and computed columns.

### Packaging

- **Prebuilt Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) binaries dropped** — GitHub's hosted `macos-13` runners are chronically starved (the v0.1.0 build sat queued past the 24-hour cap). Releases now ship `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`; Intel macOS users build from source (`cargo build -p mushroomdb-cli --release`). The Homebrew formula is arm64-only on macOS.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-21

First tagged release.

---

### Engine

- **Incremental linking rules** — declare a predicate once; every subsequent write
  evaluates it and fires or retracts the matching edges automatically. Six predicate
  kinds: `KeyMatch`, `FieldEqual`, `Overlap` (Jaccard), `NumericWithin`, `GeoRadius`,
  `VectorSimilar` (cosine). Predicates compose via `All(...)` (AND, score = min) and
  `Any(...)` (OR, score = max), nestable to depth 4.
- **Auto-FK detection** — fields ending in `_id` whose values match existing node keys
  get `KeyMatch` rules created automatically at ingest time.
- **Top-k per source** — `max_edges: Some(k)` limits the engine to the k highest-scoring
  destinations per source node; eviction and backfill fire automatically on every mutation.
- **Approximate vector mode** — `VectorSimilar` with `approximate: true` uses IVF-Flat
  candidate selection. Measured per-query recall ≥ 0.90 quiesced, ≥ 0.85 post-rebuild
  at 5k nodes / dim 1536. Exact backfill ~12 min, approximate ~17 s at that scale.
- **Crash-atomic write batches** — `write_batch(|b| { … })` commits any number of mixed
  ops in one WAL frame; on crash replay the frame is all-or-nothing.
- **Materialized views** — `create_view` maintains per-node derived properties
  (degree counts, neighbor-aggregate sum/avg/min/max/count) incrementally on every edge
  change. Values persist through WAL and snapshots; rebuild in O(nodes × degree) on open.
- **Rule suggestions** — `suggest_rules()` (and `GET /suggest`, `mushroomdb suggest`)
  profiles the data and returns a ranked list of candidate rules with estimated edge
  counts, example pairs, and rationale. No rule is ever applied automatically.
- **WAL + versioned snapshots** — CRC-checksummed WAL with per-commit fsync; versioned
  snapshots in a zero-copy archived format (V5). Open = snapshot + WAL replay. Derived
  edges are not WAL-logged; they are re-materialized from node data on open.

### Cypher

- `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `RETURN`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `SKIP`
- `WITH` pipeline stages (projection, aliasing, HAVING-style WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT,
  re-entry MATCH)
- `OPTIONAL MATCH` (left-outer-join semantics; composes with WITH and aggregation)
- `UNWIND` list expansion
- `CREATE` (nodes and relationships), `MATCH … SET`, `MATCH … DELETE`,
  `MATCH … DETACH DELETE`, `MERGE` (single-key match-or-create)
- Aggregations: `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(n)`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` — single and grouped
- Variable-length paths: `-[r:TYPE*min..max]->` and `shortestPath`; max hops capped at 10
- Query parameters: `$name` placeholders replaced at query time
- Scalar functions: `toLower`, `toUpper`, `size`, `coalesce`, `type(r)`, `abs`, `round`

### Durability

- Byte-offset crash sweep at every WAL byte verifies none-or-all atomicity and
  oracle-equivalence recovery across all predicate types, view definitions, and fulltext
  index state.
- Op-count crash sweep covers snapshot `write_atomic` and WAL-truncation `write_atomic`
  crash windows.
- Approximate (IVF-Flat) recall verified at every crash-recovery state: ≥ 0.85 floor.
- WAL replay identity for approximate rules: same rule + same data → same clusters → same
  derived edges after reopen.

### Unlocks

- **Time travel** — `open_at(&dir, commit)` replays the WAL to any past commit, giving a
  read-only view of the graph at that point. Scope: commits in the current WAL since the
  last snapshot.
- **Live subscriptions** — `subscribe_rule("name")` and `GET /subscribe` (WebSocket)
  stream `EdgeFired` / `EdgeRetracted` / `NodeInserted` / `NodeDeleted` events after each
  WAL fsync. Measured end-to-end latency: in-process p50 0.04 µs / p95 0.21 µs; over WS
  on localhost p50 61 µs / p95 88 µs.
- **Full-text search** — `enable_fulltext(label, field)` builds and maintains an inverted
  index. Queries support AND/OR boolean operators and prefix matching (`rust*`).
- **Graph algorithms** — PageRank, weakly-connected components (WCC), and degree
  centrality over the unified topology (manual + derived edges), accessible via the Rust
  API and the `mushroomdb algo` CLI subcommands.

### Clients

- **TypeScript client** (`clients/typescript`) — wraps the HTTP + WebSocket API with full
  TypeScript types. Install from the repository; npm publish pending after the first tag.
- **Python bindings** (`bindings/python`) — PyO3 thin wrapper over `core-api`. maturin
  build; PyPI publish pending after the first tag.
- **Docker image** — `ghcr.io/matthewsherlin/mushroomdb` (registry publish pending after
  the first tag). Local build: `docker build -t mushroomdb:local .`.
- **MCP server** — `mushroomdb mcp <dir>` starts a stdio JSON-RPC server exposing graph
  operations as MCP tools.

### Known limitations in v0.1.0

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| Memory-first storage | RAM-bound. Design target 10M nodes (~5–15 GB). mmap-backed storage is on the roadmap. |
| Two-hop Cypher joins at scale | Dense patterns producing >1,000,000 intermediate rows error without `LIMIT`. |
| Snapshot V4 → V5 migration | V4 snapshots are rejected by V5 code. Rebuild required: delete old snapshot directory, reopen from WAL (cold start), then call `snapshot()`. |
| Cold start without snapshot | WAL-only open re-fires all rules. At 100k nodes / 12 rules with IVF: 8.86 min (V4 baseline). Call `snapshot()` before close. |
| Approximate vector mode is opt-in | `approximate: true` must be set explicitly. Per-query recall ≥ 0.90 quiesced; review the trade-off for completeness-critical workloads. |
| No multi-statement transactions | Each API call and each Cypher write statement is its own WAL Batch frame. BEGIN/COMMIT interactive transactions are not supported. |
| Readers observe intermediate batch state | `write_batch` is crash-atomic but not isolated: readers may observe intermediate in-memory states while a committed batch is being applied. |
| Cypher write subset | SET RHS accepts literals or `$param` only; expression RHS (`n.x + 1`) is a named error. Combined MATCH…SET…RETURN is rejected. |
| `demo` refuses non-empty directories | `mushroomdb demo` exits 1 if the target directory is non-empty, including hidden files (`.DS_Store` counts). |

## Pre-1.0 breaking-format policy

Before v1.0.0, snapshot and WAL formats may change between minor versions
(`v0.x → v0.x+1`). When a format change is released:

- Old snapshots are rejected by the new code with a named error.
- A **full rebuild is required**: delete the database directory, reopen from a fresh
  ingest or re-run your write workload, and call `snapshot()`.

WAL records added in a minor version are backward-compatible within the same snapshot
series. Cross-series WAL replay (WAL from v0.x replayed by v0.x+1 code after a snapshot
format bump) is not guaranteed.

This policy does not apply after v1.0.0. Post-1.0 format compatibility follows semver.
