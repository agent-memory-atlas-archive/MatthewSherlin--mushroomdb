//! V10: the snapshot version that announces "this store uses WAL discriminant 23".
//!
//! mushroomdb's two on-disk formats fail in opposite directions. An unknown
//! **snapshot** version is refused by name — `snapshot: unsupported version
//! {N}`. An unknown **WAL** discriminant is not: `decode_all` treats a frame it
//! cannot deserialise as a corrupt tail and hands back the valid prefix, and
//! `open_with`'s `repair_wal` (on by default) writes that truncation back to
//! disk. A v0.6.9 binary opening a multiplicity-enabled store would therefore
//! lose every commit after the opt-in, and persist the loss.
//!
//! The snapshot is read *before* the WAL. So the fix is to put the loud failure
//! in front of the silent one: a store that has opted in writes its snapshot at
//! V10, an older reader stops there, and the WAL it would have truncated is
//! never opened.
//!
//! Two properties hold this up, and both are tested here:
//!   1. A store that never opts in keeps writing V9 and stays readable by
//!      v0.6.9 forever (`a_store_that_never_opts_in_still_writes_v9`).
//!   2. `enable_multiplicity()` writes the V10 snapshot *before* the WAL record
//!      it guards, so the guard is never missing when the record is present
//!      (`enable_multiplicity_snapshots_immediately`; the crash-window sweep in
//!      `crates/sim-harness/tests/multiplicity_crash_window.rs` covers the same
//!      ordering at every interruption point).
