//! What the mask actually costs on the paths §5.12 names, measured in the
//! crate that owns them.
//!
//! This release put `NodeMask::contains_id` in the inner loop of nine more
//! surfaces. §5.12 proposed a density-chosen representation for the allow-list
//! behind it, and this file is the measurement that decided it: it times
//! `query_masked`, `find_similar_vector_masked` and `neighborhood_masked`
//! against masks of 2,000 and 50,000 visible ids over a 200,000-node store —
//! the two sizes that straddle [`core_query::VisibleSet`]'s threshold, so one
//! mask is a `HashSet` and the other a bitset. The before/after table that came
//! out of it is in that type's module documentation; the short version is −29%
//! on `query_masked` and −22% on masked `find_similar` at 50,000 visible ids,
//! and nothing either way at 2,000, which is the size the rule leaves alone.
//!
//! It also times `contains_id` on its own and `NodeMask::intersect`, because a
//! whole-path figure cannot say whether a path is slow *at the probe*, and the
//! per-path share is what decides whether a faster probe is worth a second
//! representation. **Read the bare-probe leg as a floor, not as a delta**: it
//! calls `contains_id` across a crate boundary, so its before/after difference
//! also contains whatever the inliner decided about that call. The three real
//! legs above it do not have that problem — they call the mask from inside the
//! crate that owns them, which is the whole reason this harness lives here and
//! not in a benchmark crate of its own.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, because it builds 200,000 nodes and prints machine-dependent
//! timings. It still asserts, so it is a test and not a stopwatch: every key
//! each masked leg returns is visible, the row counts are the ones the mask
//! implies, and every repetition returns identical results — so a
//! representation change that alters hits or ordering fails here rather than
//! quietly shipping.
//!
//! Run it:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p mushroomdb --release --test mask_bench -- --ignored --nocapture
//! MASK_BENCH_N=50000 MASK_BENCH_REPS=3 \
//!   cargo test -p mushroomdb --release --test mask_bench -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `MASK_BENCH_N` sets the store size (default 200,000), `MASK_BENCH_REPS` the
//! repetitions per leg (default 5, median reported). One run is not a result:
//! at 5 repetitions the legs move about 10% between processes, which was enough
//! to make `neighborhood_masked` look like a 9% regression it is not. The table
//! in [`core_query::VisibleSet`] is five processes of 51 repetitions, medians of
//! the medians, and anything quoted from this file should be read the same way.
