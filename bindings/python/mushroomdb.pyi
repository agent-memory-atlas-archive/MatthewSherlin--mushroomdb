        `on_conflict` says what a node key that is already taken means:
        `"error"` (the default) rejects the whole frame with `DuplicateKey`;
        `"skip"` leaves the stored node untouched and counts it in `skipped`;
        `"replace"` makes its properties exactly the supplied props — fields
        absent from them are removed — and counts it in `replaced`. A label
        that differs from the stored one, and an `ns` that would move the node,
        are row errors under `"replace"`, not silent rewrites.

        Two properties sit outside "exactly", because neither is the caller's
        to supply: `ns`, which is immutable, and any property a view owns,
        which is kept rather than removed (supplying one is a row error, so

        counted in `kept_view_owned`, while the row still counts in `replaced`
        and raises no row error.

        Edges take the argument too, but it changes nothing for them:
        adjacency is a set, so a duplicate edge is already a silent no-op under
        every policy, and these edge dicts carry no properties to replace.
