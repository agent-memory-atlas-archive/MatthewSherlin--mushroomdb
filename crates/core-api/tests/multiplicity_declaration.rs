//! The multiplicity opt-in is a *format* declaration, and that makes losing it
//! different from losing an index declaration.
//!
//! `EnableFulltext` and `EnableIndex` describe something the store can rebuild:
//! lose one and an operator calls the enable again. `MULTIPLICITY_ENABLED`
//! describes what the store's bytes *are* — a WAL that carries discriminant 23
//! and a snapshot stamped V10 so an older binary refuses the open instead of
//! truncating at it. Lose that one and the store keeps the bytes and drops the
//! stamp: the next snapshot writes V9 while the archives still carry
//! discriminant 23, and a v0.6.9 archive scan reads them as a truncated prefix.
//!
//! Three properties are tested here, one per defect the fifth review pass found:
//!
//! * **#22** — a failure anywhere in `snapshot_with(archive_wal)`'s sequence
//!   between renaming the live WAL away and writing its replacement must not
//!   opt the store back out.
//! * **#23** — opting in must not cost the store its archive genesis chain.
//! * **#24** — a duplicate edge whose endpoints are created in the *same* frame
//!   must be counted; that shape is the primary ingest shape, not a corner.
//!
//! The sixth pass added three more, and they point the other way: the opt-in is
//! **not atomic**, and the tests below assert what the code does rather than
//! what its docstring promised.
//!
//! * **#32** — a failed `enable_multiplicity()` beside an existing archive comes
//!   back opted *in* on the next open.
//! * **#33** — the recovery's predicate, and the one invariant it must keep: it
//!   never opts in a store whose snapshot is not V10.
//! * **#34** — the rollback was never reliable: append precedes fsync, so a
//!   failed barrier leaves the declaration durable with no archive in sight.
