# mushroomdb plugin hooks: run the package, without paying npx every time.
#
# `npx -y mushroomdb@<version> …` costs about half a second before it does any
# work — a cache check, a version resolve and a Node process of its own — and
# the hooks that call it fire on every prompt and every file edit. This script
# pays that once, writes down where the package put its native binary, and
# execs that binary from then on.
#
# Measured warm, `--version` end to end: npx 514 ms, `node <launcher>` 118 ms,
# the native binary 7 ms. The launcher is only a shim that spawns the binary
# anyway, so Node's startup is nearly the whole difference — hence the order
# below.
#
# The cache is one line of text per resolved path, named for the version that
# wrote it, so a plugin upgrade resolves afresh rather than running the old
# copy. Every failure falls through to the next rung, ending at the plain `npx`
# form, which is slower and always correct.
#
# The cache lives under $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA, or $HOME/.mushroomdb, and NOWHERE
# ELSE. A line in it is a path this script `exec`s with the hook's arguments
# and the prompt payload on stdin, so where it may be read from is a security
# question, not a convenience one. Both of those directories are already the
# user's own — anything able to write there can already edit their shell
# startup files — but a world-writable fallback such as /tmp would let any
# local user drop in a path and have the next prompt run it. So when neither
# variable is set there is no cache at all: the script resolves every time,
# which is the same graceful degradation as a cache that cannot be written.
#
# Rendered from scripts/plugin-templates/run.sh.tmpl — edit that, then run
# scripts/render-plugin.sh.
