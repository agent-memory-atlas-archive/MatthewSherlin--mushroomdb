"""`GraphDb.restore(src, dst)` — the backup round trip, tested (spec §5.10).

`restore` is the CLI's `--restore-from` seeding, exposed: it copies the newest
backup under `src` into `dst` **only when `dst` holds no store**, and refuses
rather than merging when it does. The copy is staged and opened before anything
is moved into place, so a backup that does not open leaves `dst` as it was.

The point of the file is `test_restore_plus_refresh_answers_identically`: the
spec calls restore "a tested round trip", and until this release nothing from
Python exercised it at all. It runs in the normal suite, not as an ignored
benchmark.
