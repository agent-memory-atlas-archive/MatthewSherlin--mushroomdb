//! The fourteen MCP tools that answer a question in prose rather than in JSON.
//!
//! `explore`, `map`, `context`, `impact`, `owners`, `why`, `recall`,
//! `remember` and `sync` sit in front of the fourteen graph tools in
//! `mcp::tools_list`, because they are what an assistant working in a checkout
//! actually reaches for: find me this thing, what is this repository, what is
//! this symbol, what does my diff touch, who wrote this, why are these two
//! linked, what do I already know, remember this, and bring the store up to
//! date. `explain_association` answers on a store with no repository in it:
//! why these two entities are associated, with the rule that derived each
//! edge.
//!
//! Four more answer the rest of the entity graph's questions, and they are the
//! ones the first association benchmark run showed an assistant failing to
//! find. `node_edges` and `neighborhood` used to hand back a JSON array of
//! `{edge_type, src_key, dst_key, derived}` — a listing with no rule, no score
//! and no evidence, which is why a run spent 195 `query` calls and 66
//! `edge_history` calls reconstructing what one reply could have said. Both
//! now answer in prose, grouped by edge type, each listed edge carrying the
//! rule that derived it, its score, and the predicate it matched on.
//! `edges_at` answers the same question at a past commit, and `what_if`
//! answers it about a change that has not been made.
//!
//! `explore` is the composition of `context`, `impact` and `owners` behind one
//! name, and on a store a repository was ingested into it is the *only* task
//! tool `tools/list` advertises — see `mcp::Surface`. The rest stay callable
//! and are one `--all-tools` away.
//!
//! # Shape of a reply
//!
//! Every tool here answers with the rendered digest as its **text content and
//! nothing else**. It used to ship the serialised report alongside it as
//! `structuredContent`, with the same digest repeated under a `text` key: on
//! seven representative calls that was 11.6 KB of digest against 11.9 KB of
//! exact duplicate and 15.5 KB of restatement, 3.42× the text an assistant
//! reads, and it slipped past the renderers' line budgets — a default `impact`
//! capped its text at 25 lines while shipping 13 KB of uncapped report beside
//! it. No task tool declares an `outputSchema`, so nothing bound that payload.
//!
//! A program that wants the numbers asks for them: every tool takes an
//! optional `json` boolean, and with it set the reply is the serialised report
//! as the text content, with no rendered digest.
//!
//! # What each one reads and writes
//!
//! All but two are pure reads of the graph. `remember` writes one `Note`, and
//! `sync` writes nothing itself: it runs this binary again as
//! `<exe> sync <db> --json` and hands back what that reports. The server crate
//! cannot depend on the CLI crate that owns the incremental ingest, and
//! re-implementing it here would give two answers to one question.
//!
//! # Reading the working tree
//!
//! Two tools look outside the graph. `context` quotes source from the
//! repository the `GitSync` marker names, which core-api does for us. `impact`
//! defaults its file list to the current diff, taken from `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
//! when the host sets it to a checkout and from that same marker otherwise;
//! with neither, it says to pass files explicitly rather than guessing.
//!
//! # Untrusted content
//!
//! Everything these tools render came out of the graph, and a graph built by
//! `ingest-git` holds whatever contributors wrote: author names, paths, commit
//! subjects, doc comments, and — through `context` — lines of the working tree.
//! [`ok`] therefore stamps every reply with
//! [`repograph::UNTRUSTED_FRAMING`], the same marker
//! `recall_digest` puts on its own digest, so an assistant is told to read the
//! lines under it as data before it reads any of them. The renderers already
//! sanitize each line; the framing is what says whose words they are.
