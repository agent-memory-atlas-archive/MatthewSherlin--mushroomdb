mushroomdb — embedded graph database

Usage:

                     [--command <path>] [--no-git-hooks] [--no-prewarm]

                     [--always-load|--no-always-load]
                     --delivery cli writes the skill and the hooks and registers no MCP
                     server: the skill teaches `mushroomdb <command>` instead (claude-code
                     only; cursor and codex are always registered as MCP servers)
                     --intercept-grep (deprecated, removed in 0.7) adds an experimental
                     PreToolUse hook (matcher Grep) that redirects a search for a known
                     symbol name to `explore`

                     blast radius before the edit
                     --enrich-grep (deprecated, removed in 0.7) adds an experimental
                     PostToolUse hook (matcher Grep) that appends what the graph knows
                     about the symbols the search matched
                     --always-load marks the registered MCP server alwaysLoad, so the host
                     keeps its tools in context instead of deferring them; already the

  mushroomdb uninstall [--platform claude-code|cursor|codex|all] [--project|--user] [--db <path>]
  mushroomdb disable [--platform claude-code|cursor|codex|all] [--project|--user]
                     turn an install off without removing it: hooks, MCP entry and git hook
                     blocks are removed; the skill, the store and .gitignore stay
  mushroomdb enable [--platform claude-code|cursor|codex|all] [--project|--user]

                     verify an install: config entry, store, hooks, git hooks, and a real

                     (the rest stay callable, just unlisted)
  mushroomdb stats <db-dir>
  mushroomdb demo <db-dir>
  mushroomdb recall <db-dir>|--auto   hook body: reads a prompt payload on stdin, prints related graph facts
  mushroomdb brief <db-dir>|--auto    hook body: the repository in one block — size, synced sha, the most
                                      central files and the most called symbols; byte-stable, so a
                                      session host caches it once
  mushroomdb sync <db-dir>|--auto [--json]   (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   re-sync the repo the store was built from: new commits, then the
                                   dirty working tree (git hook body)
  mushroomdb map <db-dir> [--json] (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   summarise the graphed repository: clusters, key files, owners, hot files
                                   --json prints the computed map instead of the rendered digest

                                   (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   one target from as many sides as asked for: the definition and
                                   its callers (context), the blast radius (impact), the owner and
                                   what it changes with (history), or all three
                                   <target> is a file path, a symbol key, or a bare symbol name
                                   --full also quotes the body from the working tree
  mushroomdb context <db-dir> <target> [--full]   (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   one file or symbol from every side: where it is, signature, callers,
                                   callees, importers, co-change partners, commits, notes
                                   <target> is a file path, a symbol key, or a bare symbol name
                                   --full also quotes the body from the working tree
  mushroomdb impact <db-dir> <file>...   (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   what changing these files reaches: partners, importers,
                                   and the symbols other files call
  mushroomdb owners <db-dir> <path>      (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   top author and share, who else knows it, last touch, last 4 quarters
  mushroomdb why <db-dir> <a> <b>        (deprecated, removed in 0.7)
                                   every rule edge between two nodes with its evidence, or the
                                   shortest path between them
  mushroomdb touch <db-dir>|--auto [<file>...]
                                   re-extract just these files; with no <file> reads them from a
                                   PostToolUse payload on stdin (hook body)
  mushroomdb intercept <db-dir>|--auto
                                   hook body: reads a PreToolUse Grep payload on stdin; exits 2
                                   with a one-line pointer to `explore` when the pattern names a
                                   symbol the graph holds, else exits 0 in silence
  mushroomdb impact-hook <db-dir>|--auto
                                   hook body: reads a PreToolUse edit payload on stdin; prints the
                                   edited file's blast radius as additionalContext, else nothing
  mushroomdb enrich <db-dir>|--auto
                                   hook body: reads a PostToolUse Grep payload on stdin; prints what
                                   the graph knows about the symbols it matched, else nothing
  mushroomdb suggest <db-dir>
  mushroomdb asof <db-dir> --commit N [--query \"MATCH ...\"] [--namespace <ns>]
  mushroomdb query <db-dir> [--query \"MATCH ...\"] [--role <name>] [--namespace <ns>] <cypher…>
                     --role answers as one of the store's roles and --namespace from one
                     namespace; together they intersect, so neither ever widens the other
                     and either one makes the query a read
  mushroomdb snapshot <db-dir> [--keep-wal|--truncate] [--retention N]
                     folds the WAL into snapshot.bin and archives it as wal.<N>.archive,
                     so node_history, edge_history, was_linked and asof keep reaching it;
                     --truncate discards it instead, --keep-wal leaves wal.bin whole
  mushroomdb build-index <db-dir> [--rule <name>]
                     drives a rule's vector index to completion a slice at a time, for an
                     operator who wants the build finished before traffic arrives; a rule
                     created over a large corpus derives no edges until its index is whole

  mushroomdb --version
  mushroomdb --help

Default serve address is 127.0.0.1:8080. Non-loopback --addr requires --token or MUSHROOMDB_TOKEN.
install defaults: --platform auto-detect; scope auto (project inside a git checkout, else user);
the MCP entry runs `npx -y mushroomdb@<version>` unless a `mushroomdb` on PATH is this binary, or
--command names one (a relative --command or --db is anchored to the current directory).
--no-git-hooks skips the post-commit/checkout/merge sync hooks. --no-prewarm means no network and no
resolution: neither the one-off package fetch nor locating the package's binary, so every hook keeps
the slower `npx` form.
uninstall resolves the same scope and falls back to the other one when the inferred scope has no
manifest; undoing a Codex install needs --platform codex.
A project install inside a git checkout writes --auto rather than a store path, so each `git
worktree` gets its own store; outside a checkout, and with --db, the store is pinned to an absolute
path instead.
--auto resolves the database as $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/mushroom-memory, else mushroom-memory at the
root of the working tree the current directory is in, else ~/.mushroomdb/memory.
