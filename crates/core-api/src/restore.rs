//! Seeding a store directory from a backup.
//!
//! The mirror of [`GraphDb::backup_to`](crate::GraphDb::backup_to), and it
//! lives beside it for the same reason: a restore is a file-level copy of a
//! store directory followed by an open that proves the copy is a store.
//!
//! This was the CLI's `--restore-from` implementation until v0.6.10, when the
//! Python binding needed it too. `cli::restore_if_empty` is now a thin wrapper
//! over [`restore_if_empty`] here, with the CLI's error type; the semantics are
//! unchanged.
