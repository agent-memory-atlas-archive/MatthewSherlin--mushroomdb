//! The harness behind the `sanitize` ordering in `repograph::render`.
//!
//! 0.6.9 widened `sanitize` from a bare `is_ascii_control()` to the full
//! bidi/zero-width class, and every character of every digest string began
//! falling through six `matches!` arms that a plain ASCII byte can never hit.
//! 0.6.10 reordered it to test `is_ascii()` first and return.
//!
//! The reorder is provably behaviour-preserving — the `matches!` set's minimum
//! member is U+0085, so it is disjoint from ASCII, and `is_ascii_control()` is
//! false above U+007F — which means no behavioural test can tell the two forms
//! apart. Only a measurement can, and a measurement nobody can re-run is not
//! evidence. Hence this file.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release -p mushroomdb --example sanitize_bench
//! ```
//!
//! Figures quoted in the 0.6.10 changelog came from this harness on an Apple
//! Silicon laptop. They are a ratio between three predicates measured in one
//! process, not a portable number: re-run it rather than trusting the absolute
//! microseconds, and expect the *ordering* to hold while the magnitudes move.
