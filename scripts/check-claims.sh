# check-claims.sh — the v0.6.4 claim scrub.
#
# Two rules, both a consequence of the measured 0.6.2 result (240 cells: no
# correctness gain, +20% cost when used, 0 graph calls in 120 unprompted
# sessions — benchmarks/agent-tasks/results/20260910T000418Z/summary.md):
#
#   1. No product-facing file claims a coding-speed or token benefit. Measured
#      latency claims ("3.3x faster", "faster cold open") are about the engine
#      and are deliberately not matched.
#   2. No skill or rules file tells an agent to reach for the graph before or
#      instead of a search. That instruction is what the benchmark measured and
#      it is not worth what it cost.
#
# The claim scan covers every product-facing surface: the README, the llms
# files, the plugin manifests and their templates, every page under docs/site
# (the Markdown pages and the published index.html), and the three skill files.
# The grep-redirect scan covers the skill files alone, because only a skill can
# instruct an agent.
#
# Exits 1 printing file:line for every hit. Run by the plugin-validate CI job.
